Depending on your choice of weapon, you might prefer to strike your opponent from a hidden position before they ever realize you’re there, dash through a frenzied melee with pistols blazing, or glide effortlessly across the battlefield, waiting for the perfect moment to end the conflict with a single, well-placed shot.\n***During Social Encounters...***\nYou have a keen eye and can see things coming from farther than most. You might not be the life of the party, but your companions know to pay attention when your subtle nod or concerned grunt indicates that something’s amiss.\n***While Exploring...***\nYou scout the group’s position for incoming threats and help search for secret doors and hidden passages, keeping a weather eye out for unexpected threats.\n***In Downtime...***\nYou might craft ammunition or keep your complex weapons clean and maintained, and you might look for work that matches your unique talents, such as working as a blacksmith, engineer, or part of the local watch. You might wander from town to town, or stay put for a spell to enjoy the silence that lingers between gunfights.\n***You Might...***\n* : Seek out areas of great conflict where your unique choice of weaponry can help build your reputation.\n* : Explore new horizons, trusting your honed senses and deadly weapon to keep you safe.\n* : Demonstrate extensive knowledge about various types of guns and ammunition, along with curiosity about the latest in gun technology.\n***Others Probably...***\n* : Assume that since you know how your gun works, you must also understand how to resolve other mechanical challenges.\n* : Underestimate you at first glance, thinking you rely on your gun because you lack any other skills.\n* : Respect your eternal vigilance, unyielding grit, and excellent aim.\n----\n__**You are also expert with simple and martial firearms and crossbows, and trained in advanced firearms and crossbows. For now, override and update your character's proficiencies manually on the character sheet.**__",

You might often look for opportunities to acquire patronage to fund some of your more expensive or unorthodox experiments.

You might also modify previous inventions to adjust for data you’ve collected in the field.

If not, you probably record the results to try again later.\n* : Wear clothes spattered with oil and grime, or venture off on excited and technical tangents when asked simple questions.\n***Others Probably...***\n* : Marvel at your inventions and the variety of unbelievable wonder they can bring.\n* : Believe that you’re a genius whose work is beyond understanding.\n* : Worry that your inventions might backfire or explode.",

You weave your more conventional spells into the fray where more complex magic is needed, unleashing your mind's full potential in a blaze of power when the time is right.\n***During Social Encounters...***\nYou navigate situations guided by the source of your subconscious power. If your power springs from your personality, you might maneuver with empathy and sociability; if it's more cerebral, you might provide a steady logical front.\n***While Exploring...***\nYou keep your mind's eye open for the many paranormal threats that those who are less sensitive might not detect. Typically, you either scan for magic or investigate for psychic impressions, veiled thoughts, and wandering spirits.\n***In Downtime...***\nYou strive to learn more about the depths of the mind, seeking out new spells and phenomena to uncover, knowing that as you gain a deeper understanding of yourself, you can access more of the power within. You test the limits of your adaptability by retraining to fit your evolving understanding of your potential.\n***You Might...***\n* : Show a preference for learning, meditation, dreams, or other intangible manifestations of thought over the immediacy of the physical world.\n* : Learn new things about yourself, just when you thought you knew it all.\n* : Think of your psychic magic as so much a part of you that you use it even when normal methods suffice, perhaps preferring to communicate via mental messages or levitating an object to a companion at the opposite end of a table.\n***Others Probably...***\n* : Are awed by your mental abilities, especially when your psyche is unleashed.\n* : Have difficulty understanding that the magic you perform with your mind comes from the same source as more conventional spellcasting.\n* : Wonder if you might be a monster in disguise, possessed by spirits, chosen by the gods, or have some other unusual reason for your strange powers.",
