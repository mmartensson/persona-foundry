The ritual dramatically dampens harsh weather around Hillcross, causing the temperature of the area to move up to two categories closer to normal (see Table 10–13). As a result, autumns and winters are far less brutal around Hillcross, while spring and summer months are practically mild and pleasant.\nThe ritual as presented is lower level, easier to cast, and much less dangerous to the casters than the original version cast by Brogan the Grasswalker because it simply extends the original ritual's effects over Hillcross. A character who wishes to duplicate the effects somewhere else would need to develop a unique 10th-level ritual with a 5th-level ritual to extend the duration, as Brogan did, and then find someone willing to cast the deadlier initial ritual.\nCritical Success: The ritual takes effect normally, continuing the duration for 1 more year.\nSuccess: The ritual takes effect normally, continuing the duration for 1 more year, but the primary caster is drained 1. If the primary caster was already drained, increase the value of the drained condition by 1.

The primary caster is drained 2, and the secondary casters are drained 1 (increasing the value of any drained condition they already have).

If you ever ask the target to do something completely against its nature or needlessly harmful to the target or its interests, not only does it refuse, but it also can attempt a Will save to end the effect early.

This ritual must be successfully performed twice, once at each location the portal connects. While the teleportation circles and portals found in the Abomination Vaults require no additional cost to awaken, other portals might require rare items or specific materials as a cost for this ritual at the GM's discretion—some portals might even be so powerful that this ritual cannot awaken them at all.\nThe DC required to successfully awaken a portal varies based on the strength and distance between its end points. For the portals found in the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path, the DC varies according to the dungeon level on which it is located. Use the DCs by Spell Level section of Table 10–5 to determine the DC for a portal, using the dungeon level in place of spell level. Thus, activating the portal on the first level of the Abomination Vaults requires a successful DC 15 check, while activating the portal on the fourth level requires a successful DC 23 check.\nCritical Success: You awaken the portal. If its other side is awakened, the portal can be used normally and won't deactivate naturally. If its other side is not awakened, this side remains awakened for 1 year, possibly allowing you enough time to find and awaken the connecting portal.\nSuccess: As critical success, but if the portal's other side is not awakened, this side remains awakened for only 1d6 days before it fades and falls dormant again.\nFailure: You fail to activate the portal, and magical backlash leaves you stupefied 1 for 24 hours.\nCritical Failure: As failure, but in addition, a hostile creature is drawn through the portal and immediately attacks anyone present.

A geas to perform an act is usually conditional, such as, “Always offer hospitality to strangers seeking a place to stay.” An unconditional geas to perform a certain act doesn’t require the target to perform that act exclusively, though it must prioritize the task above all leisurely pursuits. The most common geas to refrain from carrying out an act is a specification to avoid violating a contract. In those cases, the secondary caster usually takes charge of making sure the wording of the contract is attuned correctly with the ritual’s magic. Because the target is willing, geas can have a duration that lasts for as long as the target agrees to. If the target is unable to fulfill the geas, it becomes sickened 1, and the sickened condition increases by 1 for each consecutive day it is prevented from following the geas, to a maximum of sickened 4. The sickened condition ends immediately when it follows the geas again; it can’t remove the sickened condition in any other way. Only powerful magic such as a wish spell can remove the effects of geas from a willing target.\nCritical Success: The geas succeeds, and the target receives a +1 status bonus to skill checks that directly uphold the geas (at the GM’s discretion).\nSuccess: The geas succeeds.\nFailure: The geas fails.\nCritical Failure: The geas fails, and you are instead affected by the geas you were attempting to place on the target. You are considered an unwilling target, so the geas can be counteracted with a (spell: remove curse) spell.\n----\n~ Heightened (5th): You can use geas on an unwilling creature; it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. If the target fails this Will save, the geas lasts up to 1 week. A remove curse spell can counteract a geas on an unwilling creature, in addition to powerful magic such as a (spell: wish) spell. A clever unwilling creature can subvert the geas by contriving situations that prevent it from complying, but in that case it becomes sickened (as described above).\n~ Heightened (7th): As 5th level, but the geas lasts for up to 1 year on an unwilling creature.\n~ Heightened (9th): As 5th level, but the geas lasts for a duration you choose (even unlimited) on an unwilling creature.",

These astral forms can be used to explore the Astral Plane indefinitely, while the targets' bodies remain safely in stasis on the plane where the ritual was cast (where they remain unconscious and can't be awoken normally). The casters must be in physical contact with one another in a circle for the duration of the casting, and all targets must be selected from these casters.\nA target's astral form is a duplicate of the target and everything they're carrying; anything that happens to a duplicate item happens to the original as well. For instance, if you use, spend, destroy, lose, or give away an item's duplicate, the original vanishes from your possession. For the duration of the ritual, any of the targets can spend a single action to (action: Dismiss) their astral form and immediately return to their physical body. As the primary caster, when you (action: Dismiss) your astral form, you can also (action: Dismiss) all the other targets' astral forms as part of the same action, returning all targets to their physical forms simultaneously. While in the Astral Plane, the other targets are unable to navigate without you, and if they become separated from you, they must wait for your return or (action: Dismiss) their own astral forms. When the ritual ends, the targets' astral forms vanish.\nA target's astral form and corresponding physical form are linked by an incorporeal silver cord, which is visible only in the Astral Plane. This nearly unbreakable cord serves as a conduit and safety line; if it is severed, the target's astral and physical forms are both immediately slain. If the ritual is interrupted by an external force, such as (spell: dispel magic) being cast on a target's physical or astral form, the target is immediately and harmlessly returned to their physical body. If a target's astral form is slain, the silver cord immediately rips them back to their physical body; the strain requires them to attempt a Fortitude save with the same DC as the ritual's primary check. On a failure, the creature dies; on a success, they become clumsy 2, drained 2, doomed 2, and enfeebled 2 for 1 week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed. A target's physical body remains in suspended animation for the duration of the ritual, but if it is destroyed, they die and their astral form also vanishes.\nThis ritual only projects a portion of the targets' consciousnesses onto the Astral Plane.

Each target's silver cord is stronger than usual, providing them a +4 circumstance bonus to their Fortitude save to avoid dying if their astral form dies.\nSuccess: You successfully project the targets.\nFailure: You fail to project the targets.\nCritical Failure: The process of separating the targets' spirits from their bodies is complicated, and something goes catastrophically wrong.

These mysterious beings may be fey, divine, or other supernatural servitors, as appropriate for the primary check. After the first hour of the ritual, these servants appear and serve a massive feast, complete with an exquisite table and up to 10 place settings. The bounteous spread consists of all manner of dishes, including the guests' childhood comfort foods, modern delicacies, and preferred drinks. The summoned servants spend the next 3 hours waiting on you and the other guests, fetching additional food, pouring drinks, and so forth. During this time, you and the other guests must strive to be as polite and gracious as possible to avoid offending your mysterious hosts. At the feast's end, the ritual is completed and you and the secondary caster attempt your checks as normal. If the feast is interrupted at any point, the servants immediately vanish with their provisions and the ritual is disrupted.\nCritical Success: The feast is nourishing and revitalizing. The magical food casts (spell: neutralize poison), (spell: remove disease), and (spell: remove fear) on each guest for each relevant affliction, using your modifier for the primary skill check as the counteract modifier. Each guest also recovers 100 Hit Points and gains 20 temporary Hit Points for the next 12 hours.

You and your guests become sickened 4 and can't reduce the condition for 12 hours.\n----\n~ Heightened (+1): Increase the Hit Points recovered by 10 and the temporary Hit Points by 2 (or twice each amount on a critical success).",

The two targets can be chosen from you, the secondary caster, or unrelated third parties present throughout the ritual. Normally, both targets must be of the same ancestry for the minds to be fully compatible, but at the GM's discretion, for a much higher cost, the targets can be from different ancestries; this requires much more adjudication of ancestry feats and abilities. When both targets are of the same ancestry, muscle memory and the influence of their soul allow them to carry over all their mechanical abilities into each new body, except they use the other body's heritage (and lineage, if any). The GM might rule that similar physiological changes can't be overridden with a mind swap.\nIf a body dies, the mind and spirit controlling it dies instantly. When the spell ends, the minds and souls snap back to their original bodies. At this time, if the original body is dead, the mind and soul attempting to return to that body die as well.\nCritical Success: Each target's mind and spirit possess the other's body and can control it normally. The mind swap is unusually smooth, and the targets gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to (action: Impersonate) each other.\nSuccess: Each target's mind and spirit possess the other's body and can control it normally.\nFailure: The ritual has no effect.\nCritical Failure: The ritual is scrambled, sending a welter of confused memories into the target's minds. You and the secondary casters are stupefied 2 for the next week.\n----\n~ Heightened (9th): You can cast the ritual without a duration, leaving no magic to counteract. The effects are reversible only by another mind swap ritual or powerful magic like (spell: wish). This increases the cost of the ritual to 10,000 gp and is an evil act unless both targets are willing.",

To conduct the ritual, you and the secondary casters must put on a long-form, multi-person, plot-based performance that's usually a play or opera, though more unusual performances have been known. You take the role of the director, while the secondary casters are either actors (Performance) or significant backstage figures, such as set or costume designers (Crafting). The casting time of the ritual includes both preparations and rehearsals of various sorts and the actual performance, which must be at least an hour long.\nThe performance presents current events and offers a particular vision on how they resolve, often in metaphorical or allegorical format (proposing the overthrow of a tyrant by referring to a different, legendary tyrant who was overthrown, or suggesting that a murderous secret might be uncovered by presenting an allegory of truth defeating murder). This performance must be presented to an audience of at least a hundred people, a majority of whom must both be connected, at least peripherally, to the events in question (the people of the tyrant's city, or the residents of the village where the murder occurred) and who must understand what the metaphor or allegory actually refers to. For the magic to spark, the performance must declare its purpose loudly and clearly to the parties most concerned. If a major antagonist featured in the performance is in the audience and the ritual is a success, you get a critical success instead.\nCritical Success: Something sublime sparks between performance and audience, and destiny conspires to push events in the right direction. You and each secondary caster can reroll up to three skill checks at any point during the duration of the ritual after determining the results, as long as the skill check is connected to ensuring the topic of the performance comes true (to sneak past the tyrant's guards or find the murder weapon, for instance).\nSuccess: As critical success except the sparks of destiny are weaker, so each caster can reroll only a single skill check.\nFailure: The ritual has no effect.\nCritical Failure: The performance is a dramatic and horrendous botch, and fate strikes out at the casters.

The spell doesn't function if any participant is acting against their will or being mentally controlled or coerced by any means, or if any participant is immune to or otherwise unaffected by their wager (such as if a construct, undead, or other creature immune to death effects tried to bet its life). At the GM's discretion, if it ever becomes permanently impossible for the bet's outcome to be determined, the spell ends without any further result.\nSuccess: The ritual is successful.\nFailure: The ritual has no effect.\nCritical Failure: The wording of the ritual is imperfect and subverts the bet, causing all bettors to be considered losers regardless of the actual result of the wager.",

When the fire is hot enough, you roast bat wings, horse hooves, and lizards over it until they're tender enough to eat; for the hooves, this could take hours. Throughout this time, you meditate and recite passages of texts holy to Lamashtu, ruminating on the beauty and necessity of the monstrous and twisting your mindset into a monstrous shape, the better to hold the evil that will come to possess you.\nOnce the wings, hooves, and lizards are cooked, you and your accomplices eat these items in their entirety, tearing them only with your teeth, and you must eat more than anyone else involved. You then scoop out a trench at the location where you previously lit the fire, folding the hot rocks into the earth. Your accomplices then bury you shallowly in the trench—you should be able to breathe but not necessarily able to see. Your accomplices then recite the correct texts and draw upon the power of transmutation while you infuse your mind further with the power and beauty of the monstrous. This stage continues for hours, until the setting of the sun. With the departure of its final ray and in accordance with your faith and occult power, you'll rise transformed.\nCritical Success: You sprout enormous bat wings, a lizard-like tail, pointed teeth, hooves, and an equine head. You gain darkvision; if you already had darkvision, you instead gain greater darkvision. You gain jaws and hoof unarmed melee (action: Strikes|Strike), which are the only attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +23 or your unarmed attack modifier, whichever is higher. Your jaws (action: Strike) deals 2d10+6 piercing damage, and your hoof Strike deals 2d6+6 bludgeoning damage with the (trait: agile) and (trait: versatile S) traits. These attacks are Strength-based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). You gain a fly Speed of 40 feet. You also gain a version of the Sandpoint Devil's Accursed Breath: once per hour, you can breathe a 30-foot cone of flame that deals 10d6 fire damage. Your mind transforms, subsuming your own personality with that of the Sandpoint Devil. Unlike many polymorph spells, you can't (action: Dismiss) this spell.\nSuccess As critical success, except your fly Speed is 20 feet, and you can use your breath weapon once per day.\nFailure: You fail to transform yourself.\nCritical Failure: Not only do you fail to transform yourself, but the ritual's secondary casters all transform into Sandpoint Devils for 1 minute, and they immediately attack you.",

The secondary caster attempting the Crafting check creates a warding diagram to prevent the extraplanar creature from attacking or leaving during the bargain; if that caster fails or critically fails, then instead of the usual effects of a failure or critical failure of the secondary skill check, the extraplanar creature can attack or leave instead of negotiate. You can also leave out this step, removing the need for a Crafting check, with the same result (if you're summoning a good extraplanar creature you trust, for example). The creature can also attack or leave if you use any hostile action against it or if the warding diagram breaks. Once the diagram is complete, you and the secondary casters each take your places at specific points at the diagram's edge where power concentrates.\nYou conjure the extraplanar creature within your wards and negotiate a deal with it, generally to perform a task for you in exchange for payment. A creature that doesn't wish to negotiate at all can attempt a Will save to stay on its home plane. Most good and neutral extraplanar creatures feel that they have something better to do than cater to the whims of mortals and require a significant gift, especially if your task poses significant risks. Evil extraplanar creatures are more likely to accept a bargain for a lower cost as long as it allows them to wreak havoc on the Material Plane or inflict evil upon the world along the way. Monetary prices usually range from the cost of a consumable item of the creature's level for a short and simple task to a permanent magic item of the creature's level or more to persuade the creature to fight alongside you. However, some extraplanar creatures may want payments other than money, such as permission to cast a geas on you to fulfill an unspecified later favor or obtain ownership of your soul via an infernal contract. If you can't come to an agreement in a reasonable length of time after you've made your case, the extraplanar creature can return from whence it came at any time.\nCritical Success: You call the extraplanar creature and bind it in the wards for up to a full day before it returns home, potentially allowing you to negotiate a better deal by threatening to leave it in the wards for the full day.\nSuccess: You call the extraplanar creature.\nFailure: You fail to call the extraplanar creature.\nCritical Failure: You call something dark and horrible, unbound by your wards, and it immediately attempts to destroy you.",

To cast this ritual, you must be on the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, or a plane that connects to one of the two.\nA demiplane created with this ritual exists on the Astral or Ethereal Plane. It can have the appearance of any mundane environment or structure, such as a glorious cathedral, a clearing in a forest, a comfortably furnished cavern, or anything else one can imagine. All demiplanes have finite, unbreachable boundaries, which might resemble stone, wood, or something more unnatural, such as a wall of mist or unceasing void.\nDemiplanes have environmental conditions as appropriate for the Material Plane, though the primary caster can dictate a general climate or light level, as well as whether the demiplane experiences seasons or a day-night cycle. The demiplane has no native plants or animals, but they can be introduced, and plants will grow in a demiplane's light.\nWhen you first cast create demiplane, the casters are teleported to the demiplane. The demiplane has no direct access to other worlds, so (spell: plane shift) or similar abilities are necessary to access it. As part of casting the ritual to create a new demiplane, you create a key to the demiplane which serves as a plane shift tuning fork for that demiplane. Most resemble ornate keys, but some take the forms of maps, compasses, or dowsing rods.\nIf you have the original key to an existing demiplane and are on that demiplane, you can instead use this ritual to either expand the demiplane or add special traits or features described below. More information about these planar features can be found here.\n* Alignment: The demiplane gains one alignment trait, such as lawful or good.\n* Bountious: The demiplane has a functional ecosystem, with plants and animals appropriate to the environment. This ecosystem doesn't require any additional effort on your part to maintain.\n* Elemental: The demiplane gains the air, earth, fire, or water planar essence trait.\n* Gravity: The demiplane gains a gravity trait of your choice (normal gravity, high gravity, low gravity, microgravity, strange gravity, subjective gravity).\n* Key: You create an additional key that can be used to access the demiplane with plane shift and improve it with create demiplane.\n* Scope: The demiplane can be unbounded instead of finite, though still with the same size.\nCritical Success: You create a new demiplane whose area consists of two contiguous squares, each 100 feet on a side. The ceiling is 20 feet high. If modifying an existing demiplane, you can instead either add this area to the demiplane's size or add two special traits or features.\nSuccess: As critical success, but the demiplane's area is a single square, 100 feet on a side and a ceiling 20 feet high. If modifying an existing demiplane, you can add one special trait or feature.\nFailure: The ritual has no effect.\nCritical Failure: Something goes horribly wrong, and all casters are teleported to an unknown but likely hostile plane.\n----\n~ Heightened (10th): The ritual creates a square area 1,000 feet on a side, with a ceiling 20 feet high (two contiguous areas of this size on a critical success).

While some versions of this ritual offer all of the forms, others include only a single form or only a few of them. Whichever form you use, the effect can’t be counteracted, though it can be ended by freedom. Some forms of imprisonment can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.\n* Chains: You bind the creature with chains, rendering it unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 × the imprisonment ritual’s spell level, and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.\n* Object (9th level or higher): You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a gem, jar, bottle, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn’t require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can’t use any other actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it. This form of imprisonment is also transmutation magic.\n* Oubliette (10th level only): You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can’t be reached by any means. You also prevent divinations from revealing the location where the imprisonment occurred. Powerful magic such as (spell: wish) can reveal the location of the imprisonment, but even such magic can’t free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-level freedom ritual can do so.\n* Prison: You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature’s prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.\n* Slumber ((trait: sleep) effect): You put the creature into an eternal sleep. It ceases aging and doesn’t require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target—whether romantically, filially, or otherwise—frees it from the slumber. This form of imprisonment is also enchantment magic.\n* Temporal Stasis: You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn’t grow older and can’t be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of imprisonment, temporal stasis can be counteracted by a (spell: dispel magic) or (spell: haste) spell. This form of imprisonment is also (trait: transmutation) magic.\nCritical Success: You imprison the target. You can either use a form of imprisonment that usually requires 1 additional spell level, or give any creatures trying to use a freedom ritual to rescue the target a –2 circumstance penalty to checks associated with that ritual.\nSuccess: You imprison the target.\nFailure: You fail to imprison the target.\nCritical Failure: You imprison yourself and the secondary casters in the same way you intended to imprison the target.\n----\n~ Heightened (9th): You can use the object form of imprisonment in addition to the other options, and you can target a creature of up to 18th level. The base cost increases to 2,000 gp.\n~ Heightened (10th): You can use the object and oubliette forms of imprisonment in addition to the other options, and you can target a creature of up to 20th level.

The crimson pillars of the Doorway itself begin to smoke, then shimmer with red light, while the air within the ring shifts and ripples as if in the throes of intense heat. A moment later, a portal to Akiton opens at the center of the standing stones. This portal is vertical and semi-circular, with a radius of 30 feet, and is filled with shimmering red energy— it doesn't provide a view of the other side. Any caster who steps through this portal is instantly transported to area B1 of the Hall of Reason on Akiton.\nSuccess: As critical success, but the portal's magic is distressed and unstable. When a caster steps through the portal, they must attempt a DC 36 Fortitude save or become drained 1 from the stress of the magical journey.\nFailure: The portal fails to open, and all casters must attempt a DC 36 Fortitude save to avoid becoming drained 1 from the backlash of magical energy.\nCritical Failure: As failure, but the misfire attracts the attention of a bythos aeon which appears in the area at once and attempts to destroy the stones of the Doorway. After one round of attacks, it realizes the portal is beyond its ability to damage, and attempts to slay those who attempted to activate the portal in the first place.",

You can alter the appearance of existing structures and creatures, and you can add illusory structures or creatures. For example, you could cause everything and everyone in the target area to appear green, create an illusory forest with a thick canopy that obscures the settlement from outside view, or make empty ruins seem inhabited and pristine. When you create the facade, you determine which illusory elements remain static (limited to basic natural movement, such as flags blowing in the breeze) and which follow a basic program (for example, a daily parade in the town square, complete with marching band). You're unable to alter the programs after you create the facade.\nYou can disguise creatures as you please, with the same effects as a 3rd-level (spell: illusory disguise). If a creature affected by the facade leaves the area, any illusions affecting it fade after 1 day. You decide when casting the ritual whether newcomers are disguised by the illusions, and whether the disguise appears immediately or after a set period, up to 1 week.\nA creature that interacts with the target settlement in a way that would suggest or reveal the illusory nature of the facade, such as by trying to paint a building affected by the facade or climbing an illusory structure, can attempt to disbelieve the illusion. The illusions created by the spell are harmless, so an illusory river of lava wouldn't cause damage, nor could thorns on an illusory rose bush prick someone.\nCritical Success: You create the facade as described, and you can alter the programs within your facade by spending 1 day to reprogram them.\nSuccess: You create the facade as described.\nFailure: Your illusions fail and the ritual has no effect.\nCritical Failure: Your ritual produces unexpected and uncontrolled illusions different from what you had planned, such as unexpected and slowly shifting colors across the buildings, unpleasant smells, and creatures appearing as skeletons.

Everything the birds see is magically transmitted back to the ambling surveyor's crew as illusory images, which the crew must catalogue in real-time if they want to use the information to fully survey the area and create a map. After two hours, the birds return. The birds use the base statistics of clockwork spies if they are attacked, or if their Perception is important to determine what they can see, although they only perform the Survey action and they don't have any of the other abilities of a clockwork spy.

Furthermore, the celebration leaves strong memories in the hearts of those who participated, causing locals to commemorate it or possibly outlaw such celebrations (depending on their view of the event).\nSuccess: The party is successful.

Many cults end their association with a wayward member on the edge of a blade, but there are options that preserve both secrecy and the life of the expelled member. An oblivious expulsion removes knowledge of the cult but is time-consuming enough that a cult usually reserves it for only the most well-regarded members who nevertheless need to be removed—or for sleeper agents the cult wishes to place among society and activate later.\nIt's difficult to cast this ritual unless the target is willing or restrained. If the creature is unwilling to accept the ritual, it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. The effects of the ritual depend on the results of your Occultism check.\nCritical Success: The ritual removes all memories of the cult's activity, practices, and secrets from the target's memory. The target remembers only what an average citizen of the larger society would know, which is typically nothing or a few rumors with very little detail. The spell is hard to detect: a (spell: detect magic) spell or similar effect must be a higher level than oblivious expulsion to detect it.\nYou can Dismiss the spell. While casting the spell, you can choose to give the secondary casters the ability to Dismiss it. You can also choose to set a key phrase or event that causes the spell to be Dismissed. When the target witnesses this phrase or event, the spell immediately ends.\nSuccess: As critical success, except the spell isn't harder to detect with (spell: detect magic).\nFailure: The ritual fails.\nCritical Failure: The ritual fails, and the target is temporarily immune for 1 month.",

The being appears as a twisted ball of vines and branches that springs forth from a nearby patch of dirt or up from between cobblestones or bricks. The ball of vines is relatively formless, giving no indication of the being that controls it. However, when you make a request, it twists into a rough face to answer your request.\nYou can ask up to seven questions that could be answered with “yes” or “no,” although the entity can give you any one working answer it wants, including vague answers like “likely” or “unknown.” The entity is likely to know answers related to its nature and priorities.

It won't attempt to deceive you, though it still might not know the answers. When it's important to provide clarity, the entity will answer your questions with up to five words, such as “if you leave immediately” or “that was true once.” The words of the entity ring with truth, and the crowd takes the statements as gospel.

The duplicate is a creature 3 levels lower than the target, with the same abilities as the target but reduced to the appropriate level (see Building Creatures). The shadow double looks identical to the target and has the same general mannerisms and personality. However, it only has a vague sense of the target's memories. It has a Deception modifier to (action: Impersonate) the target equal to the modifier of the secondary spellcaster who rolled the Deception or Performance check, with a +4 status bonus.\nCritical Success: You bring the shadow double to life. It is under your absolute control. You gain a direct mental link with the shadow double and can spend an action to command it via this link, even at a distance.\nSuccess: As a critical success, but there is no special link between you and the shadow double. You must spend an action to command it verbally or by some other means.\nFailure: The ritual fails and has no effect.\nCritical Failure: When the mirror is broken at the end of the ritual, the double appears but has the statistics of an elite greater shadow with all the knowledge of the target and the same Deception modifier a shadow double would have had if the ritual had succeeded.",
