You can ride on the broom using one hand to guide it, and the broom can carry up to one passenger in addition to you. The broom moves at a fly Speed of 20 feet.\nThe broom can carry only so much, taking a -10-foot penalty to its Speed if laden with more than 20 Bulk, and crashing to the ground if it carries more than 30 Bulk.\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS command, (action: Interact); **Effect** You name a destination on the same plane, and the broom speeds toward it at a fly Speed of 40 feet. You must either clutch the broom with two hands in order to ride it, or you need to release the broom to send it off with no rider. If you don’t have a good idea of the location, layout, and general direction of the destination, or if your named destination is on another plane, the broom wanders aimlessly, circling back to its starting location after 30 minutes.\nIf the broom carries a rider, this activation lasts until 4 hours pass (typically 16 miles of travel), the broom reaches its destination, or you (action: Dismiss) the activation. If the broom doesn’t have a rider, the activation lasts until the broom reaches its destination. When the activation ends, the broom floats to the ground and can’t be activated again for 1 hour.",

    "description": "This item consists of two magically linked rings: an intricate, gleaming golden ring with a square-cut ruby, and a thick, plain iron ring. When you wield a melee weapon in the hand wearing the golden ring, the weapon’s fundamental runes are replicated onto any melee weapon you wield in the hand wearing the iron ring. __(The fundamental runes are weapon potency and striking, which add an item bonus to attack rolls and extra weapon damage dice, respectively.)__ Any fundamental runes on the weapon in the hand wearing the iron ring are suppressed.\nThe replication functions only if you wear both rings, and it ends as soon as you cease wielding a melee weapon in one of your hands. Consequently, the benefit doesn’t apply to thrown attacks or if you’re holding a weapon but not wielding it (such as holding in one hand a weapon that requires two hands to wield).",

By placing an object of light Bulk onto the dish, you can determine its value in gold pieces in the market in which the scale was made (most of these scales are made in Katapesh or Absalom), based on its material composition and artisanship. For example, after placing a gemstone on the dish, the scale will indicate the fairest (average, in most cases) price you can expect to fetch in the market to which the scale is calibrated, but the scale wouldn’t detect the gemstone’s historical significance or any magical properties. Abadar’s flawless scale can be calibrated to a different market by performing a 1-hour ritual in the proximity of that market.",

Looking at a card without activating it shows the card face but has no magical effect. Once the deck is face down, the cards randomize themselves – if you look at the top card multiple times, you may find it changes. Any card removed from the deck goes missing after a few seconds, reappearing in the deck. __See GMG pg. 108 for advice on randomly selecting cards.__\n~ Activate: ONE-ACTION envision, (action: Interact); **Effect** You declare how many cards you will draw facedown from the deck, then draw your first card. The card takes effect immediately. Any further cards must be drawn within the next hour, and any card you don’t voluntarily draw flits off the deck and affects you anyway. You can never activate the same deck of many things again.\n:> Once a card is drawn, it produces its effect immediately and then disappears back into the deck, which immediately shuffles itself. (The Dullard and Jester are exceptions, as described in their entries below.)\nThe effects of each card are as follows:\n* Balance: Your alignment changes to a radically different one. If you fail to adhere to that alignment, you lose a level and all the benefits you gained at that level. Your XP total doesn’t change when you lose a level this way.\n* Comet: If you alone defeat the next low-threat or harder hostile enemy or enemies you encounter, you gain enough XP to reach the next level. Otherwise, you gain no benefit.\n* Donjon: You’re imprisoned by a 10th-level imprisonment ritual. This uses the prison option, typically sequestering you in a distant part of the world. You also lose all your items. Cease drawing cards.\n* Dullard: Immediately reduce your Intelligence score by 1d4+1. You can then draw an additional card, and the Dullard card then disappears forever.\n* Euryale: ((trait: curse)) A medusa’s image curses you with a permanent -1 status penalty to all saving throws. This can be removed by only a deity or the Fates card.\n* The Fates: The Fates respin the fabric of reality to save you from any situation you choose. This can reverse even a past event, and you can make the decision instantly even if the event would slay you. This intervention saves only you, not anyone else affected by the event. There’s no limit on how long you can wait before using this effect.\n* Flames: A fiend becomes filled with anger, jealousy, envy, or some other reason to despise you. Its hatred for you doesn’t cease until either it or you is dead. It attacks you or otherwise attempts to foil you within 1d20 days. The GM determines the specifics of the fiend.\n* Fool: You lose 1d10×100 XP unless you choose to draw two more cards.\n* Gem: Gain your choice of 25 pieces of jewelry worth 200 gp each or 50 gems worth 100 gp each.\n* Jester: You can either draw two more cards or gain 1d10×100 XP. The card then disappears forever.\n* Key: Gain a magic weapon of 12th level or higher. The GM determines the item and what runes it has, if any.\n* Knight: A palace guard (GMG pg. 206) arrives and swears unfailing loyalty to you.\n* Moon: Roll 1d4 to determine how many wishes the card grants you, which also affects the phase of the moon depicted on the card (1: crescent moon; 2: half moon; 3: gibbous moon; 4: full moon). These wishes each take one action to speak and have the effect of a (spell: wish) spell.\n* Rogue: One NPC ally becomes filled with hatred and immediately turns against you forever. The NPC might keep this hatred secret until an opportune moment.\n* Ruin: You lose all your non-magical possessions, including any wealth and property.\n* Skull: You must immediately battle a lesser death (Bestiary pg. 197). If slain in the battle, you can never be revived, except by a deity.\n* Star: Gain an ability boost you must use immediately on one ability score of your choice.\n* Sun: Gain 1,000 XP and a beneficial permanent magic item of 6th to 11th level, chosen by the GM.\n* Talons: All your magic items disappear permanently, except for the deck and any artifact of higher level than the deck.\n* Throne: You gain a permanent +4 status bonus to Diplomacy checks, and you now own a small castle in any open area you wish. You must choose its location within 1 hour.\n* Vizier: Upon request, you can learn the solution to any one problem or the correct answer to any one question, unless that information is obscured by a deity. This doesn’t necessarily give you the means to act on that solution. You have 1 year to take the vizier’s advice or lose its benefits.\n* The Void: Your mind becomes trapped forever. This card is fickle, but it often throws the psyche into a prison in an object on a distant plane or planet. (spell: Wish) or similarly powerful magic can reveal your psyche’s location, but it doesn’t bring you back. Your comatose body continues to function. Cease drawing cards.\n----\n~ Destruction: Trick the Grim Reaper into drawing the Skull card.",

As its owner, you can use the shot’s single-action activation after shooting it.\nInstead of rolling weapon damage dice, a shot of the First Vault deals 25 damage plus any bonuses or additional damage as if 25 were the result of the weapon’s damage dice; the damage type matches that normally dealt by the weapon. Upon damaging a creature, the shot of the First Vault shatters, and the fragments ricochet to hit any other enemies within 30 feet, making attack rolls with the same attack bonus. The shattered fragments remain lodged in the creatures they damage; the creatures are clumsy 2 while the fragments remain in place. A total of 3 actions, which have the (trait: manipulate) trait, are required to remove the fragments from yourself or an adjacent creature; alternatively, a single action and a successful DC 30 Medicine check can be used.

It is believed that orbs for other types of true dragons exist, though that theory is yet to be confirmed.\nWhile holding an orb of dragonkind, you are immune to the breath weapon of the dragon variety associated with the orb. An orb of dragonkind also grants a number of additional senses. You can communicate verbally and visually with the bearers of other orbs as if you were in the same room with them. You know if there are any dragons within 10 miles of you at all times; this extends to 100 miles for dragons of the type associated with the orb. If an associated dragon is within 1 mile, you know which direction the dragon is from you and the dragon’s age, such as young, adult, or ancient. Each orb grants a 10th-level arcane innate spell that you can cast at will, determined by the specific orb.\nThe Orb of Gold Dragonkind can convey the innate spells of any of the other orbs, as well as their activated abilities, but it can grant each individual power only once per day. In addition, the bearer of the gold orb can use its 3-action activation to attempt to cast (spell: dominate) on the bearer of another orb if they are within 1 mile, as if that bearer were a dragon of the associated type within 500 feet. The last reports of the Orb of Gold Dragonkind on Golarion indicate the orb has been destroyed, however. GMs running campaigns in settings other than the Age of Lost Omens might decide the gold orb is still intact for their campaigns.\nBearing an orb of dragonkind earns you the enmity of all dragonkind forever because you profited from the enslavement of the dragon within the orb, even if you later lose the orb.\n~ Spell Granted: (DC 40) black dragon ((spell: darkness)), blue dragon ((spell: hallucinatory terrain)), brass dragon ((spell: speak with animals)), bronze dragon ((spell: control water)), copper dragon ((spell: hideous laughter)), green dragon ((spell: entangle)), red dragon ((spell: wall of fire)), silver dragon ((spell: detect alignment) [evil only]), white dragon ((spell: wall of ice))\n~ Activate: THREE-ACTIONS command; **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** You cast a 10th-level (spell: dominate) spell (DC 40) on a dragon of the type associated with the orb within 500 feet, except the effect lasts for 1 month rather than unlimited. The dragon does not receive its status bonus to saving throws against magic. The dragon is then temporarily immune to further domination via the orb for 24 hours.\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS envision, (action: Interact); **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** You breathe an elemental blast that deals 25d6 damage (DC 40 basic Reflex save) in either a 60-foot cone or a 100-foot line (your choice). The breath’s damage type matches the Breath Weapon of the dragon type associated with the orb of dragonkind (acid for the black orb, electricity for the blue orb, and so on).\n----\n~ Destruction: An orb of dragonkind violently shatters and explodes when exposed to the Breath Weapon of a dragon who is a descendant of the dragon trapped within. The explosion deals damage as the 2-action activation above to all creatures within 90 feet.",

    "description": "This enormous, multifaceted prism normally rests on a pedestal, eerily refracting many-colored lights even when no light source is present. In reality, the prism refracts the four magical essences into the visible spectrum (see page 300 in the Core Rulebook for more on the four essences). A creature adjacent to the prism can adjust its facets with an (action: Interact) action to change between two polarities. Two essences flow from two input streams into the prism, where the prism combines them into a single output stream; alternatively, a single essence flows from one input stream into the prism and is split into two output streams. A creature that enters and stays within an input essence stream for 1 minute is slowly encased in solid magic, at which point it is paralyzed until anyone reverses the prism’s flow or finishes activating the prism. A creature stepping into an output essence stream is gently pushed back and out of the stream.\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS (action: Interact); **Requirements** The prism has only one input stream; **Effect** You alter and rearrange the facets of the essence prism, adjusting the essences to select for a single quality, which might be associated with mental essence, like a personality trait; material essence, like a physical quality; vital essence, like a belief or instinct; or spiritual essence, like an alignment component such as good or lawful. You must succeed at a secret DC 30 skill check with a skill associated with a magical tradition that uses the essence you chose (for instance, Arcana or Occultism for mental essence, as arcane and occult magic both use mental essence). On a failure, you accidentally set the prism for some other quality.\n~ Activate: 1 minute ((action: Interact)); **Requirements** The prism has only one input stream, and a creature is encased in magic in the input stream; **Effect** Over the course of the next hour, the creature in the input stream has its essences refracted through the prism, creating two cocoons of magic in the output streams that each contain a new creature. At the end of the process, the original creature is gone, and the two new creatures break free of their cocoons. Each creature is part of the original, separated from the rest based on the last quality set by the prism’s first activation. For instance, if you set the prism to “good,” one creature would have all the original creature’s good aspects and the other would be the original creature’s evil side. Unless you selected a physical quality, both new creatures look just like the original. The new creatures are usually 2 levels lower than the original, but if the original creature was strongly biased with respect to the quality you chose (for instance, if splitting out the good and evil side of a redeemer), the stronger creature is 1 level lower and the weaker creature is 3 or more levels lower. If calibrated correctly, this activation can also reverse the effect of the third activation.\n~ Activate: 1 minute ((action: Interact)); **Requirements** The prism has two input streams, and a creature is encased in magic in each of the input streams; **Effect** Over the course of the next hour, the essences of both creatures in the input streams are refracted through the prism, creating a cocoon of magic in the output stream that contains a new creature. At the end of the process, the original creatures are gone, and the new creature breaks free of its cocoon.\n:> The new creature is an amalgam of the originals, with a new personality blended from both, and is usually 1 or 2 levels higher than the higher level of the original creatures unless the lower-level creature was much weaker. This activation also reverses the effect of the second activation.\n----\n~ Destruction: Forcing the essence prism to combine two incompatible demigods destroys the prism, though it might also result in a new divinity.",

When using the extractor to (action: Craft) an alchemical item or with infused reagents as part of your daily preparations, you can create impeccable alchemical items. An impeccable alchemical item always uses the maximum numerical value possible for any rolls it requires, such as dealing maximum damage with alchemist’s fire or restoring the maximum number of Hit Points with an elixir of life. If the impeccable item has a duration, it lasts twice as long as normal. Finally, an impeccable alchemical item never has a drawback.\n~ Activate: THREE-ACTIONS (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** You use the extractor to produce an alchemical item of your level or lower whose formula you know. The extractor can create 56 levels’ worth of items per day in this way.\n:> For example, the extractor could create two (item: true elixirs of life | Elixir of Life true) (19th level) and two (item: moderate elixirs of life | Elixir of Life moderate) (9th level), or eight (item: greater comprehension elixirs | Comprehension Elixir greater) (7th level), and so on.\n~ Activate: 1 hour ((action: Interact)); **Effect** You take a sizable portion of a creature (at least two-thirds of its original mass) and filter it through the mechanisms of the extractor. After the end of the process, the philosopher’s extractor creates a transmogrifying mutagen that imparts the essence of the creature to the drinker. The extractor can make several transmogrifying mutagens simultaneously using the same activation if enough mass is provided at once, up to a maximum of 10 concurrent mutagens. Drinking a transmogrifying mutagen imparts you with one of the creature’s unique abilities for 1 hour. This could grant one of several abilities such as a dragon’s Breath Weapon, darkvision, flight, frightful presence, or immunity to sleep. The ability functions as it did for the original creature, except it uses your class DC or your spell DC (whichever is higher) instead of the creature’s DC.\n:> The mutagen grants only abilities based on a creature’s physiology and never grants magic-related abilities such as innate spells or spellcasting ability. The GM ultimately decides what ability a transmogrifying mutagen grants.\n:> Unlike normal for mutagens and (trait: polymorph) effects, you can drink multiple transmogrifying mutagens and gain benefits from each. When you drink transmogrifying mutagens made from different creatures, you receive abilities from each creature. When you drink multiple transmogrifying mutagens made from the same type of creature, such as multiple mutagens made from trolls, you gain an additional ability for each transmogrifying mutagen you drink, and the duration of the abilities from that creature type increases by 1 hour for each additional concoction you drink.\n:> However, these additional benefits come with a risk; if you drink a transmogrifying mutagen while at least one other is active, after drinking it, you must succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to the total number of active transmogrifying mutagens you’ve consumed. On a failure, you fully transform into a member of the species of the latest transmogrifying mutagen you drank, and you almost always go berserk from your change. The transformation may leave some amount of your personality and memories intact, at the GM’s discretion.\n----\n~ Destruction: Simultaneously feeding the philosopher’s extractor sizable portions of an aeon, angel, archon, azata, daemon, demon, devil, protean, and psychopomp, each of at least 14th level, along with a philosopher’s stone causes the device to jam, overheat, and explode.

    "description": "Worn on a necklace, this intricate key grants you greater facility with constructs. The key alerts you to constructs lurking around you. Whether or not you are (action: Investigating | Investigate), the GM automatically rolls secret (action: Recall Knowledge) checks for you when you see a construct pretending to be a normal object, statue, or the like. Typically, this check is Arcana, Crafting, or an appropriate Lore skill. On a success, you recognize the presence of the construct and gain the usual benefits of (action: Recall Knowledge).\nA greater key allows you to fully comprehend and thus partially bypass a construct's resistances. You ignore the first 5 resistance a construct has against your damaging effects, whether martial or magical.\nWhile you're wearing the key, if your attack reduces a construct to 0 Hit Points, instead of destroying it completely, you can send it into a dormant state, from which you can study its inner workings and possibly (at the GM's discretion) spend time and money to reprogram or repurpose it. Even if you don't subvert it, you can (action: Repair) a construct rendered dormant this way, allowing you to return tomb guardians to their vigil after you've battled them. Additionally, you can activate the key in two ways to call a construct to serve you.\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS command, (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You turn the key in the air and create a magic glyph. The key casts 5th-level (spell: summon construct).\n~ Activate: 1 minute (command, envision, (action: Interact)); **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You place the key on a Small object and turn it, creating a simple animated object for 8 hours. The animated object has the statistics of an animated broom but has no bristles (action: Strike) and can't attack. It performs simple and broad menial tasks for you in exploration or downtime but is too slow to react to individual commands to assist you in a combat encounter.",

    "rarity": "UNIQUE",
    "description": "Gauntlight is much more than a 115-foot-tall lighthouse rising from the heart of an old ruin in Fogfen – its pale stone walls extend far below the ruins, passing through eight different dungeon levels and finally terminating at the ninth level below the surface, where its deep foundation centers on an ominous chamber where, long ago, Nhimbaloth herself once physically brushed against this world. Once she finished its physical construction, the sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex used this spot as a source of power to infuse the walls, floors, and ceilings of each of Gauntlight's levels with eldritch power. The lens at the apex of the lighthouse would have, in time, been able to focus this lingering eldritch energy into a powerful beam, but Belcorra's plans were cut short before she could replace the mundane lenses with dangerous magical ones.\nAs an artifact, Gauntlight can't be damaged by normal means. Its walls are impenetrable and impervious to any attempt to breach them by anybody except for followers of Nhimbaloth. They block effects that allow temporary passage, such as (spell: passwall), and also create a barrier against dimensional travel. The walls attempt to counteract (trait: teleportation) effects and planar travel into or out of areas within Gauntlight and efforts to summon creatures into the area (using a +37 counteract modifier); this effect does not stop a summoned creature from departing when the summoning ends.\nIn Gauntlight's current state of diminished functionality, it can be activated only in the two ways below. By swapping in a series of magical lighthouse lenses that focus Nhimbaloth's baleful gaze – lenses so powerful that even Belcorra takes special care with them – the artifact gains significantly greater power, including the ability to reach all the way to Absalom and to activate its effects every minute. These lenses are described in “Eyes of Empty Death,” the third adventure in the __Abomination Vaults Adventure Path__.\nTo activate Gauntlight, a creature must be in the deepest portion of the artifact (this chamber is in the Temple level and is presented in “Eyes of Empty Death”). From this point, a creature can observe the world outside remotely through Gauntlight's lens, including any area Gauntlight's beam can reach.\n~ Activate: THREE-ACTIONS (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per month; **Effect** A pale blue beam shines from Gauntlight's lens and illuminates a 30-foot-radius burst centered on any point within 1 mile. The light saturates the region, causing any corpses in the area or within 10 feet of the surface of the illuminated area to animate as level -1 undead (typically as skeleton guards or zombie shamblers). Once animated, the undead remain active until slain. Until then, they remain uncontrolled and are driven only by the desire to slaughter the living. If Gauntlight is fully restored, the undead instead animate as any Common undead of 15th level or less, as the user wishes.\n~ Activate: THREE-ACTIONS (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per month; **Effect** A pale blue beam shines from Gauntlight's lens and illuminates a 30-foot-radius burst centered on any point within 1 mile. The user chooses one creature of 4th level or less that is physically located within Gauntlight; this creature is then is teleported to any point within this illumination radius. If Gauntlight is fully restored, any number of creatures within Gauntlight of 15th level or lower can be transported. This is a (trait: teleportation) effect.\n----\n~ Destruction: If Belcorra's ghost is permanently destroyed, Gauntlight loses all of its magical properties and collapses in on itself all the way down to its base, leaving an incredibly deep pit in the Fogfen.",

    "rarity": "RARE",
    "description": "This hefty tome was compiled centuries ago by an anonymous author who sought to collect all parables, myths, stories, and encounters with the Outer Goddess Nhimbaloth. According to the introduction, the author's original intent was to create a work that foes of the Empty Death could use to fight against her influence, but as one reads through the book, it becomes apparent that the opposite effect has been achieved – by compiling these stories, the author inadvertently generated a work that made it easier for Nhimbaloth to influence the world. Those who venerate the Empty Death seek copies of this book to use as a guide and religious text, while those who don't know better and peruse the book as though it were merely an anthology of stories find themselves unwittingly falling prey to Nhimbaloth's cult or agents of the entity herself. Those who study from The Whispering Reeds for too long are often cursed to rise as ghosts after death – though their existence never lasts for long, as they are inevitably consumed by Nhimbaloth.\nIf a character understands the dangers of this book, however, moderated use can stall or even prevent such a fate from befalling them. If a character takes special care, they can even potentially use The Whispering Reeds for its original purpose – as a weapon against the cult of Nhimbaloth. Using the text too often or leveraging some of its more powerful effects, however, causes the user to feel an ominous chill. In these cases, the user is exposed to the tome's curse, Empty Death (see below).\nThe anonymous compiler wanted to produce an enormous print run of The Whispering Reeds, but after the initial run they realized the danger and scuttled those plans, instead attempting to destroy those copies already created. This crusade caught the attention of Nhimbaloth's cult, who swiftly assassinated the compiler. Fewer than two dozen copies of this rare tome are believed to still exist. The book's sinister nature causes all attempts to transcribe it to fail, resulting in bodies of gibberish, nonsense text.\nThe Whispering Reeds provides several abilities, but you can't activate any of them while you are stupefied unless you are a follower of Nhimbaloth.\n~ Activate: 10 minutes ((action: Investigate)); **Effect** You gain a +2 item bonus to skill checks to (action: Recall Knowledge) about Nhimbaloth, her faith, or creatures associated with her (such as incorporeal undead, vampiric mists, wisps, and other incorporeal creatures associated with death). Each time you use this ability after the first in a 24-hour period, you are exposed to the Empty Death.\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS command, (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You read aloud a phrase from the book and target a single incorporeal undead creature within 30 feet. That undead creature takes 5d6 positive damage (DC 27 basic Will save) as portions of their incorporeal being are consumed in patches of seven equally spaced holes. Each time you use this ability after the first in a 24-hour period, you are exposed to the Empty Death.\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS command, (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You invoke a tale from The Whispering Reeds that parallels the situation, environment, or creatures nearby. Eerie mists and indistinct whispers rise in a 20-foot emanation around you, and clusters of seven perfectly spaced divots manifest in the ground, vegetation, and flesh of creatures in the emanation other than yourself and up to three creatures you designate at the time of activation. Creatures afflicted with these divots suffer from agonizing mental anguish in the form of crippling despair and take 4d6 mental damage (DC 27 basic Will save). The mists, whispers, and strange divots fade away at the end of the round, but any creature that takes mental damage from the effect also takes a -1 penalty to saving throws against effects with the (trait: emotion) trait for 1 minute. You are exposed to the Empty Death each time you use this ability.\n~ Activate: (activity: Cast a Spell); **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** You cast one of the following spells at the lowest level possible (unless otherwise specified): (spell: crushing despair) (one target within 30 feet only), (spell: fear) (3rd), (spell: paranoia), or (spell: phantasmal killer). You are exposed to the Empty Death each time you use this ability.\n----\n~ Empty Death: ((trait: curse), (trait: necromancy), (trait: occult)) **Saving Throw** DC 27 Will; **Effect** If you activate The Whispering Reeds and are not a worshipper of Nhimbaloth, you become stupefied 2 for 24 hours as your thoughts fill with paranoia that something is watching you from the other side of death. If you die while affected by the Empty Death, you immediately become a chaotic evil ghost. Every 7 days that pass after you become a ghost, you must succeed at a DC 2 flat check – failure indicates that you are consumed by Nhimbaloth. A creature whose ghost is consumed in this way does not travel to the River of Souls and is utterly annihilated; this creature can only be restored to life via a 10th-level spell effect or ritual like (spell: wish).\n----\n~ Destruction: Copies of The Whispering Reeds have no special protections and can be destroyed like any regular book, but doing so exposes the one who destroyed the book to the Empty Death.",

This illusion can be seen through with true seeing or similar magic, and anyone who interacts with the item feels its wet and sticky surface, allowing them to attempt to disbelieve the illusion (DC 19). Many hags claim a hag eye is more effective if plucked from a living, awake creature, but this is likely just a convenient excuse for sadism.\nThe hag eye produces no direct benefit for the wearer, but allows the hag who created it, or any member of her coven, can peer through the eye using the (action: Seek) action. This has no range limit, provided the hag is on the same plane.\nAny damage dealt to the eye destroys it. If this happens while a hag is looking through it, the hag is blinded for 1 hour.",

    "description": "A brain cylinder allows the extracted brain of a Large or smaller creature to continue to function even after it has been removed from the body. As long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature remains alive and can continue to think, even though its body is dead. Detachable modules that fit into the base of the cylinder allow the brain to see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker. So long as these are attached, the brain can speak and understand any languages it knew in life, though nothing within the cylinder compels it to do so if it is unwilling. It also retains its living alignment, and can use Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skills. A standard brain cylinder has one skill at +15, one at +13, and two at +11, as chosen by the GM.\nThe brain retains no other abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental ones. Mi-go typically preserve humanoid brains in this manner when they wish to interrogate a creature at a later date, or when they wish to preserve a creature as a resource for consultation or research purposes, as a brain preserved in this manner can live for centuries. If a brain cylinder is destroyed, the brain dies and its soul finally moves on to the Boneyard. Restoring a brain in a brain cylinder to its former body can be done by any effect that restores life (and, in most cases, any capable of creating a new body, since the original is typically missing or long gone).\nNote that the level 6 brain cylinder presented above represents a level 6 creature's brain. A less powerful or more powerful brain can be placed in a brain cylinder, which can affect the brain cylinder's Perception, mental ability scores, Will save, and skill modifiers (and can drastically alter the value of the brain cylinder), but the physical properties of the brain cylinder remain unchanged. Higher-level brain cylinders can be crafted, with resistances and weaknesses increasing as appropriate to their level. However, they always have low AC and HP and terrible Fortitude and Reflex saves for a creature of the brain cylinder's level (see the Building Creatures rules, GMG pg. 56).\nYou can open a brain cylinder by taking three consecutive actions with the (trait: manipulate) trait. If the brain cylinder contains a brain, the brain dies 3 rounds after it's removed or if the cylinder is left open for more than 10 minutes. You can transfer a brain from one brain cylinder to another with a DC 25 Medicine (expert) or Occultism (expert) check. This is a two-action activity with the (trait: manipulate) trait. On a critical failure, the brain dies.",

Today, this final scope might well be the last one to survive the passage of time.\nA starless scope is a handheld telescope crafted of silver and fine wood. When one peers at the sky through a starless scope, one always views the sky as if during a clear night. A starless scope adds a +2 item bonus to Astronomy Lore and Perception checks made to observe the skies, as it causes all celestial objects to dim when not directly observed, allowing its user to more easily observe their intended subject. It also grants a +2 item bonus to all Occultism checks made to (action: Identify Magic).\nA starless scope also functions as a divine focus for worshipers of Desna. The magic of a starless scope requires a specially prepared lens to function, and it's possible to shatter the lens if you roll poorly when activating the starless scope.\nWithout a functional lens, a starless scope doesn't function. You can replace a shattered lens with a functional lens by taking a two-action activity with the (trait: manipulate) trait. If you know the formula for the starless scope, you can (action: Craft) a new lens with a DC 25 Crafting (master) check. A starless scope lens is a level 9 item worth 100 gp.\n~ Activate: REACTION (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** you use the starless scope as a divine focus; **Requirements** you worship Desna; **Effect** You attempt to enhance the effects of a spell as you cast it by attempting a Religion check against the spell's DC.\n~ Critical Success: Any attack rolls you make with the spell gain a +2 status bonus, and any saving throw a foe makes against the spell takes a –2 status penalty. If you would normally cast the spell from a spell slot, and the spell is 5th level or lower, you don't spend the spell slot and cast the spell from the starless scope instead.\n~ Success: Any attack rolls you make with the spell gain a +1 status bonus, and any saving throw a foe makes against the spell takes a –1 status penalty.\n~ Failure: The spell is cast normally. Attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a failure, the starless scope's lens shatters.\n~ Critical Failure: The spell is disrupted and the starless scope's lens shatters.\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS (action: Interact) ((trait: abjuration), (trait: divine)); **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You raise the scope to your eye and observe a creature within 30 feet. You can attempt to identify the creature by (action: Recalling Knowledge | Recall Knowledge). The starless scope adds a +2 item bonus to this check. If the creature is associated with the Dominion of the Black or the Elder Mythos, or is a creature whose actions have blasphemed against Desna (Ioseff Xarwin's ghost falls into this latter category), the creature must attempt a DC 27 Will save.\n~ Critical Success: The creature is unaffected, and the starless scope's lens shatters.\n~ Success: The creature shines with starlight for 1 round. During this time, the creature can't be concealed if it is visible. If it's invisible, it's concealed rather than being undetected. The creature takes a –1 status penalty to saving throws against (trait: divine) effects while it shimmers with starlight.\n~ Failure: As success, but the creature also suffers an additional effect.

    "rarity": "UNIQUE",
    "description": "The Void Mirror was created on a distant planet by a now-extinct alien cult to aid in unlocking the secrets of the Dark Tapestry. It appears as a 5-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror of dark glass. As long as it's unmounted in a frame, the Void Mirror functions only as a mirror, save that it always reflects the sky as if it were night, regardless of the time of day. When the Void Mirror is mounted in a frame, it instead serves as a window into space, displaying a star field in its glass rather than a reflection. This frame can be of any quality, but stouter frames help to prevent the frame's destruction and thus help to keep the Void Mirror functional.\nThe view presented by the Void Mirror is any view of the night sky possible from its current physical location, regardless of time of day. Observations of the sky in this way add a +3 item bonus to Astronomy Lore or Perception checks made while using the mirror. The point of view can be shifted through hand gestures, causing the scene within the mirror to reorient in any direction desired.\nA character who peers into the starscape within the Void Mirror must attempt a DC 41 Will save. On a failure, the character feels something looking back at them from the dark places between the stars. On a critical failure, this sensation causes the character to become frightened 1. The character is then temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.\nBy placing the Void Mirror in a specially-constructed frame (such as the one within the Cosmic Crypt in the Malevolence adventure), it can halt the ongoing transformation of a creature that has performed the apotheosis activation. Building such a frame is beyond the skill of low-level characters, as it requires an artisan with legendary proficiency in Crafting.\nThe Void Mirror can be utilized in other ways, but before a character can activate these effects the occult methods to access these ritual-like effects must be Researched separately. Since the specific methods for these activations vary slightly from person to person, these methods can't be taught; each person who seeks to activate the Void Mirror in one of the following ways must complete their own research to unlock the artifact's secrets. Each requires a separate number of Occultism checks to Research, as detailed below for each activation.\n~ Activate: 1 hour ((action: Interact)); **Research** Accumulate 12 RP by making DC 20 Occultism (expert) checks when Researching (1 week per attempt); **Frequency** once per month; **Effect** The first activation ritual is known as “Speak to the Void” and allows the user to contact an intelligence in a distant part of the universe, provided the mirror shows that location (regardless of distance). This alien intelligence infuses the user's mind with answers, allowing the user to (action: Recall Knowledge) using Nature or Occultism as if they were legendary proficiency with the skill (including the +8 proficiency bonus). If this check fails, the character takes 10d6 mental damage (100 mental damage on a critical failure) as the imparted knowledge does more harm than good.\n~ Activate: 7 days ((action: Interact)); **Research** Accumulate 12 RP by making DC 40 Occultism (legendary) checks when Researching (1 year per attempt); **Frequency** once per century; **Effect** The third activation ritual is known as “Become the Void” and requires the user to continue performing the rite for 7 consecutive days (as if they were performing a multi-day ritual). If the user fails to perform this rite for one of these 7 consecutive days, they immediately suffer the critical failure effect below.\nCritical Success: The user's body, mind, and soul are infused with alien energies drawn from the Dark Tapestry, which transforms the user into an aberration of a level no higher than their current level +4. This new form could be an existing aberration or a unique one of the GM's creation. The user retains their memories and spellcasting ability (including any rituals they know) but becomes chaotic evil and loses all other abilities they possessed in their previous form.\nSuccess: As critical success, but the aberration the user transforms into can be of a level no higher than half the user's current level.\nFailure: The user's attempt to change is a painful mistake that deals 10d6+40 bludgeoning damage as their body twists, bends and breaks. Ultimately, they are not transformed.\nCritical Failure: The user is slain, but their body shifts and transforms into a brand new creature as the bodiless alien intelligence Tchekuth incubates within the user's flesh, mind and soul. This transformation takes another 7 days to complete but can be halted indefinitely if the Void Mirror is placed in a specially constructed frame aimed at the body's location (regardless of any solid object between the mirror and the body). Slowing or stopping this transformation via other means requires complex rituals or divine intervention, subject to the GM's whim. After 7 days, the body completes its transformation and Tchekuth rises once more as a physical threat.\n----\n~ Destruction: A creature that completes the apotheosis of Becoming the Void can destroy the Void Mirror by smashing it, though doing so also destroys the creature performing this action in a violent burst of occult energy.",

    "description": "This deck of 54 cards appears nearly identical to standard playing cards. Comprised of four thematic suits of 13 cards each, as well as two wildcards, the deck of mischief is a favorite of scoundrels who prefer not to leave their games to chance—or to at least nudge the odds in their favor. If you know how to activate the deck, you can illusorily transform the ace and face cards into other cards in the deck.\nThe deck is true to its name and less likely to comply with your wishes if not well cared for. While surprisingly resistant to the elements, a waterlogged, dirty, or battered deck may not function as desired, giving you incorrect information about which cards are still in the deck or failing to hold the illusion at a critical moment. If a deck becomes incomplete due to damaged or missing cards, it rapidly loses its deceptive capabilities and might even purposefully sabotage you.\n~ Activate: ONE-ACTION envision, (action: Interact); **Effect** You learn which of the ace and face cards are still in the deck. You can then swap the apparent face of an ace or face card in your hand (if you have any) with the face of one still in the deck. A creature who (action: Seeks|Seek) or touches the card can attempt to disbelieve this illusion (Perception DC 20).",

While common decks are inexpensive (costing 5 sp), limited-edition decks with elaborate art and high-quality materials are often highly sought after by collectors. A deck has negligible Bulk, and takes both hands to use. In a classic Old Mage Deck, the 13 cards in each suit are as follows, with Jatembe's Ten Magic Warriors as cards 2 through 11: Initiate (1), Red Hyena (2), Grey Elephant (3), Golden Snake (4), Black Ibex (5), Frog of Shifting Colors (6), Emerald Spider (7), Walnut Hawk (8), White Bull (9), Blue Leopard (10), Black Heron (11), a different creature for each suit representing the given suit's magical essence (12), and Old Mage Jatembe using magic of the suit's essence (13). Wildcards vary from deck to deck, making each Old Mage Deck unique.\n**Old Mage Deck Substitutions** \nOld Mage Deck|Standard Deck|Minor Arcana\n:--|:--|:--\nSuit of Matter|Diamonds|Pentacles\nSuit of Spirit|Clubs|Wands\nSuit of Mind|Spades|Swords\nSuit of Life|Hearts|Cups\nOne|Ace|Ace\nEleven|Jack|Knight\nTwelve|Queen|Queen\nThirteen|King|King\nWildcards|Jokers|Any two Pages  or Major Arcana  cards",

    "description": "~ Activate: ONE-ACTION (action: Interact)\nThe aquarium lamp is a combination light source and exotic animal aquarium, intended to provide rich nobles amusement and illumination. It takes the shape of a glass cube 50 feet wide and seven feet high filled with sea water, flanked by two much smaller water tanks. A sparse brass frame around the device keeps the tanks themselves from touching the ground and serves as a mounting point for a pair of electrical coils on the top, which are enclosed within separate glass tubes. Six electric eels swim within the central tank, while a number of animals belonging to species considered to be the eels’ natural prey swim in the smaller feeding tanks. With the simple pull of a lever attached to either smaller tank, one of the prey animals is released into the eel tank. Within seconds, the eels converge on the hapless animal, using their electrical charges to stun their victims. When this happens, the salty seawater conducts the electrical energy into transfer coils hidden within the brass frame, which send the energy to the top-mounted electrical coils. The end result produces enough light to fully illuminate a room as though it were midday.\nThis device is an expression of a recent trend among certain Avistani nobles to blend form and function in their manors’ interior decorations. In such circles, ostentatious decorations that serve no functional purpose are derided as “tacky” and “unrefined.” If a noble in such company wishes not to be ridiculed, they must be sure that each decoration adds something to the room beyond the aesthetic. The aquarium lamp is the latest tool in this social arms race, and it’s already proven popular with its target market.\nWhen active, the aquarium lamp produces bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet). Each activation provides enough energy for 10 minutes of use, and the two feeding tanks combined carry enough prey animals for 50 activations before needing to be refilled, though electric eels usually need feeding only once per day, and won’t go after the prey if they’re all full. While electric eels are not aggressive to their aquarium keepers and will gradually learn to associate them with food, they can engage in violent social behavior, especially when they are young. This behavior leads to small fights involving tail slapping, biting, and discharged electricity, the last of which causes the lamp to illuminate without hitting the lever to release prey. The electric eels live around 15 years if kept well-fed.",

    "description": "Sometimes, just disguising one’s face just isn’t convincing enough. Clockwork disguises were invented to supplement regular disguise kits, which are used all across Golarion. For example, if a spy wants to infiltrate a military camp, they must be wearing the same type of armor as the soldiers stationed there—or else have a very good explanation for their commander as to why they’re out of proper uniform! The clockwork disguise is intended to help avoid such awkward, potentially fatal confrontations.\nThe clockwork disguise looks like a harness connected to hundreds of small metal plates that cover the user’s torso and arms. Each of these plates is equipped with several hinges, allowing them to be shaped into a wide variety of patterns. When these shaped plates are arranged and connected, they can be made to look like almost any basic suit of light or medium metal armor, though armor embellishments such as those worn by high ranking officers are beyond this device. The arrangement process takes some time, but once it’s completed, the user need only perform a few simple adjustments to a clockwork mechanism in the disguise to make the plate arrangement into a new preset configuration. Afterwards, when the user flips a switch on the harness’s belt to one of three positions, the plates shift, overlap, and connect as necessary to transform the disguise into the desired preset configuration. The clockwork disguise can have up to three preset configurations at a time, and most users use a minimum of two: the one required for their current task, and a suitably inconspicuous configuration for when the first configuration is unnecessary.\nGiving a clockwork disguise a new preset configuration requires 20 minutes of work. The clockwork disguise can have a maximum of three preset configurations at a time, and it can only mimic light and medium armor suits made of metal.\nThe clockwork disguise is light armor and has the following stats, regardless of which type of armor it mimics: **AC Bonus** +2; **Dex Cap** +3; **Check Penalty** –1; **Strength** 12; **Group** plate\n**Activate** ONE-ACTION (action: Interact); **Effect** Transform the clockwork disguise into any one current preset configuration of the user’s choice.",

    "description": "A clockwork megaphone uses cunning clockwork gears to adjust the shape and angle of the cone within the megaphone, allowing you to raise or lower the volume, widen or contract the angle in which you project your voice, or both at the same time. This makes a clockwork megaphone far more useful than an ordinary megaphone for situations where you want to make sure that everyone in a particular venue or location can hear you without being so loud that your voice comes across as a painful shout. It takes 1 minute to wind up a clockwork megaphone, which allows it to remain active for up to 1 hour of adjustments, only counting the time you change the megaphone’s settings, not the time you spend speaking. Since it automatically enters standby mode when not in use, this typically means you don’t have to wind up the clockwork megaphone for months, or even years, depending on how often you adjust the settings each day.",

    "description": "The light writer is a cutting edge invention, first created in Absalom in late 4721, combining magic and clockwork innovation to allow its operator to create a true-to-life, monochromatic portrait of people or a scene over the course of 20 minutes of exposure. It consists of two flat metal squares, one larger than the other, connected by a tube of leather similar to that found on a bellows. The smaller square, which sits at the front of the device, has a small glass lens in the center of it. The larger square contains a specially treated metallic plate on the inside; its exterior also has both a small control stick connected via flexible wire, and a small metal tube attached to the top and pointing forward. The user presses a button on the control stick to activate the light writer. Upon activation, magical light illuminates the tube, producing a steady light for 20 minutes. This light is captured by the lens and projected onto the metal plate, slowly creating an image of the scene in front of the lens. It costs 3 gp for 10 metal plates. The plate can then be removed, allowing the image to be displayed anywhere the owner desires. The light writer is mounted on a tripod and must be perfectly still during operation to prevent any defects from appearing in the plate image. If creating a captured image of a living creature, it is equally important for that creature to remain still throughout the process, to avoid a ghostlike blurring of the final image. ",

    "description": "The nightbreeze machine can turn a scorching hot room into a comfortable one with just the pull of a lever. Its outer shell is a brass cube half as tall as the average human that houses a series of flat metal “blades” in a circular arrangement. When placed on a flat surface, a creature within reach can (action: Interact) to flip the lever, turning the machine on. When the machine is active, the blades begin to spin rapidly, setting the air in the room into motion, which cools off the room’s inhabitants. A front-mounted metal grate prevents anyone from coming into accidental contact with the spinning blades without impeding airflow.\nThe nightbreeze machine was recently commissioned by Malduoni, Keeper of the First Law, leader of the nation of Rahadoum. He tasked the country’s brightest inventors with creating devices that would, in his words, “Ensure that no mortal need fear death from the desert heat.” This machine was the first creation to come out of this consolidated engineering effort, but it won’t be the last.\nA nightbreeze machine can affect an enclosed area of no more than 50 feet by 50 feet and has negligible effect when used in a larger enclosed area or outside. While active, it reduces the effects of severe heat by one step to mild heat, and reduces extreme heat to severe heat. A nightbreeze machine isn’t powerful enough to reduce the effects of incredible heat, though fortunately such heat isn’t found naturally in the deserts of Rahadoum. A nightbreeze machine runs for 8 hours, after which it must be wound in a process that takes 10 minutes to complete. The 8 hours of activity don’t have to be consecutive.",

    "description": "Whether it’s a parchment with ominous pentagrams and dangerous magical symbols inscribed upon it, incriminating legal documents, or just simply paper waste, sometimes you just need to make sure a document is completely destroyed in a way that makes it nearly impossible to read afterwards. Enter the paper shredder, a clockwork device that performs exactly this function.\nWith 1 minute of wind-up, a paper shredder can function for up to 1 hour of shredding, and it automatically enters standby mode when not in use, meaning the device can typically go for weeks between wind-ups unless you shred an exceptionally large volume of paper.\nSetting a piece of paper or parchment into the paper shredder takes a single (action: Interact) action, which means you can shred up to three pages of paper or parchment each round. If the page is longer than normal, it takes longer to shred, as determined by the GM. Additionally, only one person can use the shredder each round, limiting it to shredding three pages per round regardless of how many people are available to feed paper into it. The paper shredders rips and tears the paper or parchment apart into tiny disjointed strips. This is typically sufficient to destroy (spell: glyphs of warding|Glyph of Warding) and other similar dangerous magical traps on the paper, though the GM might determine that particularly resilient magical traps find some way to survive their shredding. If the paper is magically protected or otherwise has more Hardness than a normal sheet of paper or parchment, the shredder can’t shred it. After churning such hardened paper for 1 round, the shredder spits it back out without harming the shredder. This prevents shredding any other paper during that round.",

In Alkenstar’s hands, the musket was used to defend the burgeoning Grand Duchy from outside threats, including mutants of the Mana Wastes, Nexian constructs, and undead from Geb. After Ancil’s death, the weapon was passed down, per his own decree, not to his heirs but to the greatest defender of Alkenstar, as determined by the weapon’s previous owner. Over time, the devotion and heroism of each successive wielder left a psychic imprint on the weapon, until it developed an intellect and drive of its own.\nA duchy defender is a powerful weapon with a rigid personality. It follows the laws of Alkenstar to the letter, and fights in defense of its nation. If these two priorities ever clash, a duchy defender prioritizes the protection of Alkenstar and its citizens over following the laws themselves, since laws can change, but the people will always need protecting.\nIf you break the laws of Alkenstar, a duchy defender goes out of its way to call attention to you at inopportune times, such as when you’re engaged in an illegal activity, and attempts to see you pay for your crimes, up to and including outing you to law enforcement and providing testimony against you in court.

One of a set of four guns crafted as a gift to a Zenj family for delivery of rare healing and disease abating herbs during an outbreak of a deadly disease in the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, these firearms are now passed down to those who have done brave acts in service to the Zenj people. The flintlock sparks thrown by this weapon take the shape of pouncing tigers and the firearm’s report sounds like a tiger’s growl. Clever wielders use the firearm’s report to panic their prey into mistakes and then pounce for the kill.\nThis firearm’s bullets deal slashing damage instead of piercing and add an additional 1d6 persistent bleed damage on a critical hit. This persistent bleed damage causes tiger-claw-shaped wounds to appear on the target.\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS envision; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You capitalize on the fears your firearm engenders, terrifying your foes.

If you successfully deal damage to your target, the target is also affected by a 4th-level (spell: phantasmal killer) with a spell DC of 28. While (spell: phantasmal killer) typically takes the shape of the target’s worst fear, this effect always appears to the target in the form of a majestic and ferocious tiger.",

    "description": "The clockwork diving suit is a marvel of technology that allows its user to breathe underwater for hours at a time without the aid of magic. Compared to a more traditional magically-assisted diving suit using a bottle of air, a clockwork diving suit is both less expensive and better protected, making clockwork diving suits a good choice for characters who prefer more protection. However, they also come with a built-in time limit, which magical diving suits circumvent. A clockwork diving suit is a bulky, fully sealed suit of armor lined with a complex series of filter-equipped bladders that store and circulate air for the user to breathe. A glass faceplate on the front of the helmet allows the user to see what’s going on in front of them.\nThe suit’s rigidity and mechanisms severely restrict the user’s range of movement and keeps them from moving faster than a slow walk on the sea floor. To compensate for this, a clockwork water jet mechanism is installed in the suit’s back. The water jet includes both a vacuum system and separate air bladder; it’s activated with a simple pull of a lever on the suit’s belt. When the lever is pulled, the vacuum system sucks in seawater, and seconds later, the air bladder sprays the water out and propels the user short distances. This mechanism is also necessary for the suit to surface without walking to shore—it’s too heavy to float on its own. Most wearers can only swim a few feet before sinking back to the water’s floor.\nThe diving suit contains enough air for three hours of operation, and the clockwork components can operate for up to 3 hours before the suit needs winding. If you run out of air, drowning and suffocation rules begin to apply as normal. This air supply can be refilled by spending one hour in an area with air, and you can rewind the clockwork in a process that takes 10 minutes to complete.\nThe diving suit is a suit of medium armor, and it has the following stats: **AC Bonus** +4; **Dex Cap** +1; **Check Penalty** –4; **Speed Penalty** –15 ft; **Strength** 18\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS (action: Interact); **Effect** The diving suit shoots out a water jet that causes you to Swim 25 feet in a straight line. The distance of this movement is unaffected by your swim Speed, if you have one, or the armor’s Speed penalty. However, difficult terrain, such as the difficult terrain for moving up or down or moving against a current, still slows this movement.",

The handgrip beneath the flared muzzle is a well-positioned bulging tree knot, and the long stock looks as if it was grown to fit you. On closer examination, the whorls and rings in the wood resemble eyes. Arboreal’s revenge is a haunted firearm constructed with wood hewn from a living arboreal, slaying the arboreal and trapping its spirit in the firearm. Perhaps a patient wielder could one day put the arboreal’s spirit to rest, or at least come to terms with it, abating the drawbacks of the weapon while keeping its advantages.\nWhen you first fire arboreal’s revenge, the (item: blunderbuss) fuses with you, after which it’s almost impossible to remove it from your possession with a (spell: remove curse) or similar effect, like many cursed items. You gain weakness 5 to fire and the flat check for you to recover from persistent fire damage increases from 15 to 17, or from 10 to 12 if you receive appropriate help.\nWhenever you wield arboreal’s revenge, the arboreal spirit bound to the (item: blunderbuss) attempts to overtake you. The wood handgrip sprouts roots which grow around your hand, binding both of your hands to the firearm. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC when defending against checks to (action: Disarm) you. However, you can’t (action: Release) your grip on the (item: blunderbuss) until you forcibly tear off the roots, though they do allow you to move your hands enough (and only enough) to reload and fire the (item: blunderbuss).

You can coax it into performing them each intentionally once per day, with the following activations.\n~ Activate: FREE-ACTION command; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The arboreal haunting the (item: blunderbuss) attempts to regrow itself into a new physical body by sprouting from the bodies of all the creatures that the firearm recently harmed.

On a failure, they take a –10-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds as roots rapidly sprout from their wounds, which lasts until they (action: Escape) (DC 20).\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS command, (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You cast (spell: barkskin) from the (item: blunderbuss) as a 2nd-level primal spell.

Through decades of effort, it gained the ability to communicate empathically, then telepathically. Now, the weapon is capable of exerting its influence over other inanimate objects. Despite the weapon’s progress, years of feeling helpless have given the animate dreamer a singular goal: to obtain and occupy a body of its own.\nAn animate dreamer is cunning, intelligent, and patient.

Therefore, an animate dreamer is just as happy in a living body stolen from an innocent as it would be in an artificially constructed body, or even an undead corpse.

When activated, it grows to fill a solid square or rectangular space no more than 20 feet on any side. The cube fills spaces well enough that Tiny creatures can't slip through, but it's far from a perfect seal. Liquids, gases, and minuscule creatures such as insects can still find ways around it. Depending on the irregularities of the space the cube fills, it might be possible to see or hear past it. When you activate the barricade stone, you drop it on the ground, throw it up to 20 feet away, or sling it using a sling weapon. Upon landing, the stone instantly and permanently expands. The stone grows to its maximum size. While normally items with the (trait: structure) trait put creatures in their area inside the structure, this effect creates solid stone, so it can't be placed in an area where there are creatures. While it's likely to take some time even with the right tools, an activated barricade stone can be destroyed the same as any normal stone structure (Hardness 14, HP 56).",

The shadow lasts until that target is reduced to 0 Hit Points, that target moves more than 400 feet from you, or that target moves to an area where no shadow could be cast, such as an area of complete darkness, whichever comes first.\nThe shadow doesn’t take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would, and it automatically follows the chosen foe. The shadow can’t make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons do not apply to it.",

    "description": "A memory palace is an elaborate magical structure that safely stores memories for easy access. It appears to be a miniature Taldan villa small enough to fit in the palm of a human hand.\n~ Activate: (10 minutes) envision, (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The miniature grows into a building connected to the Astral Plane for 1 hour. The memory palace has a 30-foot-square central courtyard surrounded by 12 10-foot-square chambers. Arranged within these chambers are various items referred to as the palace’s nodes—statues, tapestries, fountains, and other works of art are common, but a node can take other forms at the GM’s discretion. As a 10-minute activity, you can imprint one extended memory onto a node: the contents of a specific simple book, for example, or the events of a recent adventure. When you do, the node changes its shape and appearance to visually represent the memory you have imprinted onto it. If the node was already imprinted with a memory, the old one can be overwritten to repurpose the node.\nMemories you have imprinted on a node can be mentally accessed at any time by a creature holding the memory palace in its miniature form, regardless of who imprinted them. This grants a +2 item bonus to (action: Recall Knowledge) checks relating to details specifically occurring within the memory. What exactly qualifies is up to the GM’s discretion, but a node shouldn’t grant the benefits for most uses of a given skill. For example, a node dedicated to a book about trees found in the Mwangi Expanse would help with (action: Recall Knowledge) checks for such trees, but it wouldn’t grant the benefits for all Nature checks to (action: Recall Knowledge).\nA memory palace node can also store the text from a spellbook or magical tome, but these memories aren’t a substitute for having the book in your possession. A wizard can’t prepare spells from a memory palace, though they could use it as source material to try to (action: Learn a Spell). However, since storing spells in a node would only benefit someone else who later discovers the memory palace, few choose to take such an action. The memories contained within the nodes aren’t real, and thus don’t cause harmful effects, even if the source of the memory was a mental danger. Many memory palaces have leftover memories from previous users—now long dead—imprinted on their various nodes.",

After failing to counteract a silence spell, the armor can’t attempt to counteract the same spell again, even if you leave and enter the spell’s area multiple times.\n~ Activate: ONE-ACTION command; **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** You have a pool of Focus Points and at least one composition spell; **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point and immediately use the Focus Point to cast (spell: lingering composition), using your Performance check to determine the effects of the spell, followed by the (spell: inspire defense) composition cantrip. You can use this activation to cast those spells even if you don’t have the (feat: Lingering Composition) or (feat: Inspire Defense) feats.",

Succeed or fail, that color then disappears from your field of light.\nSecond, any creature that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon is affected by a random remaining color from your field.

This tenet doesn't prevent you from looting those you harm primarily in the defense of yourself and others.\nWhenever you violate this code of conduct, one of the golden branches tarnishes (and utterly egregious violations might tarnish multiple branches).

Ridill is a (item: +3|+3 Weapon Potency Runestone) (item: major striking|Major Striking Runestone) (item: dragon bane|Bane Runestone) (item: speed|Speed Runestone) adamantine (item: greatsword). While wielding Ridill, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against fear. This increases to +4 if the effect is from a dragon. If you have an ability that depends on Large weapons (such as barbarian giant instinct), it works with Ridill.\nRidill is always considered to have the appropriate material or damage type necessary to deactivate a dragon's regeneration or cause the dragon's weakness to apply. For example, Ridill is considered to be cold iron when attacking a linnorm, while it would be treated as having dealt cold damage when attacking a red dragon. If the dragon has more than one weakness, only the highest value applies.\n~ Destruction: If you boil Ridill in the blood of 10 different types of dragon (blue dragon dragon, red dragon, etc.) and drop the eye of a cyclops seer into the brew, Ridill melts away into nothingness.",

The spear has the thrown 30 feet weapon trait, in addition to the normal weapon traits for a longspear.\nWhile the Spear of the Destroyer's Flame is in your possession, you gain fire resistance 20. When you critically hit a creature with the spear, the creature's blood begins to boil, unleashing blasts of heat from the wound. The creature takes 2d8 persistent fire damage, in addition to the persistent fire damage from the greater flaming rune; all creatures adjacent to the creature when it takes the persistent fire damage take an equal amount of fire damage. Like the fire damage from the greater flaming rune, this fire damage ignores a creature's fire resistance, though it doesn't ignore fire immunity.\nIn addition to its deadliness as a weapon, the Spear of the Destroyer's Flame gives its wielder full control over the Army of Fire, though the orders of the Commander of Flame supersede the orders of anyone wielding the spear, as noted below. While the spear is in your possession, you're aware of the location of the Army of Fire and the army's distance from you. In addition, you can give orders to the Army of Fire, and the army's members will understand and obey you, regardless of what language you speak. If you're within 1 mile of the Army of Fire, the army and its members gain a +10 circumstance bonus to their Speeds. Any members of the Army of Fire within 100 feet of you become quickened and can use the additional action to (action: Step), (action: Stride), or (action: Strike). The army remains quickened for 1 minute after moving further than 100 feet from you.\nThe Army of Fire has unwavering loyalty to the Commander of Flame, an individual who has completed a special activation that ties their soul to the spear. As long as the Army of Fire can see and hear the Commander of Flame, the army will follow the Commander's orders. The Commander of Flame can sense the presence of the Army of Fire and issue orders, regardless of language, with the same effects as for someone in possession of the spear. The Commander of Flame still needs the spear in hand to muster the Army of Fire, however.\nIf the Commander of Flame doesn't hold the Spear of the Destroyer's Flame for 1 week, it returns to Cuetzmonquali's gut, instantly teleporting to the creature's location. If Cuetzmonquali is dead at this time, the spear also resurrects the creature, using the effects of a critical success on a 10th-level resurrect ritual.\n~ Activate: 1 minute (envision, (action: Interact)); **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You attempt to tie your soul to the spear. If the current Commander of Flame still lives, you must attempt either a Will save, Diplomacy check, Intimidation check, or Warfare Lore check. The DC of this check is equal to the current Commander's Will DC, Diplomacy DC, Intimidation DC, or Warfare Lore DC, whichever is highest. On a success, you become the Commander of Flame. On a failure, the current Commander knows your name and appearance and is aware of your exact location for 24 hours.\n~ Activate: 1 hour (envision, (action: Interact)); **Frequency** once per week; **Effect** You use the spear's power to muster the Army of Fire. You can choose to either call the Army of Fire to your location or move yourself to the army's location. When calling the army, you select an area you can see within 500 feet. The army is instantly teleported to the location you select, spreading out as necessary to arrive safely. When moving yourself, you instantly teleport yourself to a location within 500 feet of the army. The army is composed of souls given form as burning humanoids, elementals, spirits, and undead.\n~ Destruction: If the entire Army of Fire is destroyed and the Commander of Flame is slain with the Spear of the Destroyer's Flame, the spear shatters into a massive explosion of flame, dealing 20d10 fire damage in a 30-foot burst (DC 43 basic Reflex save). In addition, the Commander's soul burns away to nothing, destroying the Commander forever and releasing the bound souls of the Army of Fire to the River of Souls.",

Furthermore, while the constellation lasts, if you Cast a Spell that has a range and that spell would affect only the marked creature, the spell's range is increased by 30 feet.

This filth can be washed away normally, but it inevitably returns as long as you continue to wear a clean mudlily.\nIf you soil the mudlily with some dirt or mud, as long as you wear the flower, you instead become clean over an hour. Any gunk soiling your person vanishes completely from everywhere on your body except the mudlily. Each day at dawn, the mudlily instantly becomes clean again.",

    "description": "Created by the Kellid goddess Sister Cinder to lead her believers out of the Age of Darkness, this hand-held lamp is constructed from animal bone, hide, and sinew, and it contains an eternal flame that requires neither fuel nor oxygen to burn. The lamp's flame can be covered or hidden, but it can't be smothered or quenched. While uncovered, the Primordial Flame sheds bright light in a 100-foot radius (and dim light for the next 100 feet). If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, the Primordial Flame attempts to counteract the darkness with a counteract level of 10 and a counteract modifier of +35.\nThe presence of the Primordial Flame alters the surrounding environment, changing weather patterns, temperature, climate, and even seasons. Within a 10-mile radius of the Primordial Flame, the temperature remains 70° F (21° C) during the day and 60° F (16° C) at night. The weather is calm and free from extreme weather conditions (such as blizzards, hail, thunderstorms, and tornadoes), and the sky remains clear. Plants in the area flourish as if they were receiving optimal sunlight, water, and nutrients for their species, despite the lack of precipitation. If the Primordial Flame remains in the same region for an extended time, the area of this effect increases (typically by 1 mile each year, though terrain and other factors might alter this limit). During the time Venexus carried the Primordial Flame, its environmental reach expanded to cover the entirety of Lost Mammoth Valley.\n~Cursed: The Primordial Flame was cursed by Syarstik Painted-Tiger, the guardian spirit of Red Cat Cave. As long as it remains cursed, a creature that holds the Primordial Flame can't willingly give up possession. A creature that has held the Primordial Flame and no longer has it in their possession is wracked with mental anguish, becoming clumsy 4, enfeebled 4, stupefied 4, and fatigued; these conditions can't be reduced or removed until the creature regains possession of the Primordial Flame or the curse is removed. The curse can be removed only by avenging Syarstik.\nActivate TWO-ACTIONS command, (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per week; **Effect** The Primordial Flame's light intensifies, shedding bright sunlight in a 10-mile radius (and dim light to the next mile) for 1 hour. If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, the Primordial Flame attempts to counteract the darkness with a counteract level of 10 and a counteract modifier of +35.\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS command, (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The Primordial Flame casts a 7th-level (spell: sunburst) spell. If you can cast spells higher than 7th level, the Primordial Flame automatically heightens (spell: sunburst) to half your level rounded up.\n~ Activate:  command, (action: Interact); **Effect** The Primordial Flame casts a 5th-level (spell: produce flame) spell. If you can cast spells higher than 5th level, the Primordial Flame automatically heightens (spell: produce flame) to half your level rounded up.\n~ Destruction: If used to slay a herald of Sister Cinder while on the Shadow Plane, the Primordial Flame is destroyed.",

Some of the knights’ Magaambyan allies believe the stones are aeon stones corrupted by the same energies that corrupted the Gravelands, though they don’t display the characteristic orbiting behavior of aeon stones when invested. Despite the controversy, many knights use the stones for their ability to detect the presence of undead.\nWhile you have a detector stone invested, it glows faintly when an undead creature is within 30 feet of you, unless the undead is hidden or disguised with a Deception or Stealth result of 20 or higher. An invested stone may be carried in a pocket, but some knights set them in necklaces, bracelets, or weapon hilts.\n~ Activate: ONE-ACTION envision; **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** You channel your life-force into the stone, empowering it temporarily. The stone can detect undead within 60 feet of you, rather than 30 feet, until the end of your turn. Undead hiding or disguising themselves must make an additional Deception or Stealth check to remain disguised or hidden from the activation, and the DC of the check is 23 rather than 20.\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS envision, (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You focus on the stone as it glows, and your eyes glow with the same tainted light. You detect the auras of evil undead in a 30-foot radius around you and learn each aura’s location and strength. This has the effects of a 2nd-level (spell: detect alignment) spell but only detects evil undead.",

The spike is attached to a 50-foot-long coil of rope held in a simple spool that can be attached to a weapon's barrel. The weight and awkward balance of the bolt and its spool reduce the range of the weapon by 10 feet when fired. A creature hit by a harpoon bolt takes normal damage from the shot and must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save. On a failure, the harpoon bolt becomes lodged in its body.\nOnce a harpoon bolt is lodged, a creature can remove the harpoon bolt with a DC 18 check to (action: Escape) or (action: Force Open), but on a failure, the creature takes 1d4 piercing damage. As long as the harpoon bolt remains lodged, the creature can't move more than 50 feet away from you. You can attempt to (action: Trip) a creature by tugging on the rope attached to the harpoon bolt, even if it isn't within your reach, but if you fail this attempt, the bolt rips free, causing 1d4 piercing damage to the target but releasing it from the bolt. If you reload, drop, or fire the firearm again, the creature is no longer limited in its movement. Once a harpoon bolt is removed from a creature, the bolt, its rope, and the spool all decay away, consumed by the same magic that empowers the unusual ammunition to function in the first place.",

The Book of Lost Days permits you to view another's memory, which contains information about that subject commensurate to rolling a total of 40 to (action: Recall Knowledge) about the topic, with additional context provided on a success or critical success.\nThe price for this knowledge is the memory of a day in your past, and the vitality of a day in your future. You lose the memory of that day completely, and the total of all the knowledge you learned on that date is added to the book's repository of information. The book, not you, chooses which memories are taken, preferring days with concentrated emotional resonance, and thus tends to steal significant life moments. This loss affects only your memories; it has no effect on your level, class, feats, or other character choices.\nYour natural lifespan is also shortened by 1 day. The loss of this life energy causes you to be drained 2. You can't reduce the drained condition for 2 days, after which you can recover normally from the condition.\nCreatures have occasionally managed to use the Book of Lost Days not to gain others' knowledge but to wipe their minds clean of painful memories or deadly secrets. Their memories aren't destroyed but merely stored in the book, where someone else might later retrieve them.",

    "description": "Many secret societies dabble in ancient lore and rare antiquities. If one were to ask what their greatest challenge is, instead of evading police attention or dealing with the occasional mystic curse, most members would say it's separating counterfeit goods from real ones. Almost anything can be counterfeited, and counterfeiting is a major criminal enterprise with its own tricks, techniques, and intricacies. Some counterfeiters specialize in the production of adulterated coinage, while others produce beautiful legal documents with forged signatures and stolen stamps. Another class of forger produces artwork in the style of some great master, while ancient relics can be churned out by the dozen in subterranean workshops.\nYou can hire a counterfeiter to create low-grade, medium-grade, or high-grade counterfeit goods. In all cases, the goods can still act as mundane examples of their type (a counterfeit copy of the queen's longsword is still a longsword), and if the original is enchanted, then the counterfeiter attempts to fake the appropriate magical auras. Counterfeit goods don't have any other magical powers, though—a counterfeit scroll can't be used to (action: Cast a Spell), for example. A counterfeit good can't be cheaper than the base item. For example, the sword couldn't be cheaper than a longsword, nor the scroll cheaper than a piece of parchment.\nAn item sold to a store goes through a rigorous vetting process that is extremely likely to detect a counterfeit, so a secret society member can't simply create counterfeits and then sell them at a profit. Counterfeits excel in situations where the item's hand-off is illicit or the item doesn't need to pass intense scrutiny from an appraiser.\n~ Detecting Counterfeits: Determining something is counterfeit requires inspecting the item and succeeding at a relevant skill check against the counterfeit's DC. Typically, this is Crafting, but one might use Religion to detect a fake reliquary or Medicine to realize a potion is mere snake oil. Low-grade counterfeits typically have a very easy DC of the item's level, medium-grade counterfeits typically have a standard DC of the item's level, and high-grade counterfeits typically have a hard DC of the item's level.",

This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.\nA mindrender baton's power is provided via a battery, but King Irovetti has used his supply of them over the years. Whether or not you want to allow the PCs to discover replacement batteries to recharge this device is left to you to decide, but certainly batteries are not available in markets outside of Numeria itself—and even there, their availability isn't guaranteed. When this campaign begins, the mindrender baton Irovetti carries is fully powered and has 10 charges available. Charges are expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below for each activation's “Charges” entry.\nThe mindrender baton can be used as a (item: club).\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS (action: Interact) ((trait: mental)); **Frequency** once per day; **Charges** 1; **Effect** You point the mindrender baton at a target creature within 60 feet and cause the target to suffer cripplingly painful headaches.

The target must attempt a DC 31 Will save.\nCritical Success: The target is unaffected.\nSuccess: The target is stunned 1 as it fights off the intrusion into its mind.\nFailure: You take command of the target and it becomes controlled, following your orders; if you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order. The creature can attempt a new DC 31 Will save at the end of each of its turns; on a success, the effect ends. Another character can attempt a DC 32 Diplomacy (master) or Intimidation (master) check against the effect's DC of 31 to remove this effect before then, but if this attempt fails, the commanded creature becomes temporarily immune to that character's attempts to remove the effect via skills for 24 hours.\nCritical Failure: As failure, but the target receives a new save only if you give a new order that is against its nature, such as to kill its allies.

    "description": "An oculus of Abaddon is a potent artifact rumored to have been created by one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as a way to reward those who work as their agents on the Material Plane. More likely, these items were crafted by a powerful pre-Earthfall death cult that has long since moved on, leaving behind these dangerous artifacts to tempt mortals into serving the needs of the Horsemen.\nAn oculus of Abaddon appears as a sphere of clear crystal that contains a pinpoint of flickering red light at its center. When held, the oculus feels warm to the touch and fills you with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place the oculus within the socket—this causes 4d6 persistent bleed damage. Once placed in an eye socket, the oculus can be removed only by ripping it free (causing the same amount of persistent bleed damage as the initial plucking). When you place the oculus in your empty eye socket, you immediately heal all damage caused by plucking the previous eye out. Once placed, an oculus grants you constant darkvision. It can also be activated to perform a number of other magical effects, as detailed below, but if you aren't evil, each time you activate an oculus of Abaddon, you must succeed at a DC 36 Will save or become affected by a (spell: subconscious suggestion) (heightened to 8th level) to perform an evil act the next time an opportunity to do so arises, as determined by the GM.\n~ Activate: 10 minutes (envision); **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** You gain the effects of (spell: scrying), heightened to 7th level.\n----\n~ Activate: Cast a Spell; **Frequency** once per week; **Effect** You use the oculus of Abaddon to cast a planar binding ritual, heightened to 7th level. You can only conjure neutral evil creatures with this casting of planar binding. If you already know the planar binding ritual, you gain a +3 item bonus on the primary check when casting planar binding.\n----\n~ Activate THREE-ACTIONS envision; **Requirements** you have a familiar or animal companion; **Effect** You can see and hear through your familiar or animal companion's eyes and ears, provided you are on the same plane. This effect can be sustained, but as long as you do so you can take no other actions.\n----\n~ Activate: 1 hour (envision; (trait: evil)); **Frequency** once per year; **Effect** You manipulate the minds of a huge number of targets, provided that the end goal of the manipulation is a tragic or otherwise horrific fate for those being manipulated. This functions as (spell: suggestion), but with a range of 1 mile. All creatures within this area are affected, with the same suggestion implanted in their minds. Creatures hear the telepathic suggestion in their native language, and creatures that are 7th level or higher can attempt a DC 36 Will save to resist the effect. This power was used by Vordakai to cause the vanishing of Varnhold, suggesting to its inhabitants to leave their homes and travel south to his tomb. If this effect is counteracted or removed on one victim, it ends for all victims.\n----\n~ Destruction: A foul and hideous object, an oculus of Abaddon is fortunately relatively easy to destroy, as far as artifacts go. It has Hardness 25 and 100 Hit Points, but repairs damage to itself swiftly, regaining 10 Hit Points per round. It has weakness 10 to bludgeoning damage and weakness 30 to good damage.",

If its partner goes too long without fighting, the sword misleads its wielder into believing they're the real Armag and that anyone around them who isn't obviously a member of their lineage or following is a mortal enemy. The cursed greatsword also slowly changes the features of the wielder over the course of several days or even weeks to appear as those of the original Armag. If left unchecked, these powers seemingly bring the warlord back to life—it's the wait for this subtle transformation to be complete that's kept the current “Armag” in meditation in the tomb for so long. The long-term effects on a PC as a result of this curse are left to the GM to adjudicate, but at the very least should result in a gradual shift of the PCs' alignment to chaotic neutral. If 24 hours pass without Ovinrbaane being used in an encounter of at least moderate difficulty, its partner becomes irritable and short-tempered, and is stupefied 2 until the end of their first turn in a moderate or more difficult combat.\nOvinrbaane is a (item: +2|+2 Weapon Potency Runestone) (item: striking|Striking Runestone) (item: wounding|Wounding Runestone) (item: greatsword). It can perform all of the following activations, but only does so when its wielder is in combat against a foe the sword deems worthy—that is, any creature of the wielder's level or higher.\n~ Activate: ONE-ACTION command; **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** Ovinrbaane casts (spell: bless).\n----\n~ Activate: REACTION ; **Frequency** three times per day; **Trigger** Ovinrbaane's partner becomes immobilized or restrained; **Effect** Ovinrbaane casts (spell: freedom of movement) (heightened to 8th level) on its partner\n----\n~ Activate: REACTION ; **Frequency** three times per day; **Trigger** An undesirable spell effect with a duration affects Ovinrbaane's partner; **Effect** Ovinrbaane casts (spell: dispel magic) (heightened to 8th level, counteract check +31) on the spell.\n----\n~ Destruction: In order to destroy Ovinrbaane, its wielder must bring it to the Boneyard, where they must use the sword to strike three blows against their own gravestone, causing the sword to shatter. How one can find their own gravestone in the Boneyard when they have yet to die and be judged, of course, can be a complex problem to solve, perhaps requiring the destroyer to first die, be judged, sent on to the afterlife, and then be restored to their original mortal life through the result of an epic quest by allies or the whims of a deity.\nAlternately, if Ovinrbaane is left unused for a hundred years, its magical powers grow dormant. At this time, the weapon can be destroyed normally, although it still has Hardness 30 and 120 Hit Points, and at the end of any round during which it is not destroyed, its dormant powers awaken again if it succeeds at a DC 5 Flat Check. Since the blade is currently active, this option doesn't present a particularly viable one for PCs seeking the artifact's destruction during the course of the Adventure Path— although sealing it away in a vault could be an excellent first step in this process, entrusting the final destruction of the dangerous artifact to some future generation of hero.",

The ring of bestial friendship was created by Nyrissa for a specific reason: to allow her pawn Eirikk to manipulate the beasts of the Stolen Lands so as to sow discord among the PCs' nascent kingdom. As long as someone wears it, she can use spells like (spell: discern location) and (spell: scrying) on that person as if she possessed a part of their body. This effect does not work in reverse, despite being crafted from a lock of Nyrissa's hair. Instead, any attempt to use the ring as a body part to aid in casting a spell causes the ring instead to explode into a blast of lightning that causes 6d6 electricity damage to all creatures within 20 feet (DC 20 basic Reflex save). This destroys the ring and automatically counteracts the spell effect that triggered the explosion.\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You cast (spell: charm) (heightened to 4th level) on an animal or beast within 30 feet. If the spell succeeds, it forms a mental bond between you and the target for the duration of the charm, which allows you to remain aware of the creature's present state, its direction from you, it's distance from you, and any conditions affecting it, as long as you are both on the same plane of existence and are both alive. If you fail to affect the creature with this charm, or once the charm ends (such as if it is counteracted, or its duration expires), the creature becomes enraged and is immune to the ring's charm from that point on. The creature's rage drives it to attack you and grants it a +1 item bonus on all checks and DCs to do so for 1 hour.",

This destroys the rod and causes 10d6 piercing damage and 10d6 slashing damage to the rod's wielder (DC 36 basic Reflex save). Additionally, if the rod is destroyed through other means, the rod's current wielder must make a successful DC 11 flat check to avoid having the rod explode in the same way.

While the Stag Lord himself wears this helmet in the Kingmaker Adventure Path, stag's helms are actually the creation of the church of Erastil, and worshipers of this deity find that the helm is not only particularly comfortable to wear, but that they can activate it once per hour rather than once per day.\nRather than restrict the senses, a stag's helm enhances them, causing the world to appear in more vibrant colors and significantly enhancing the ambient sounds of the region without making them distracting. While worn, it grants a +1 item bonus to Perception checks.\n~ Activate: FREE-ACTION ; **Frequency** once per day (or once per hour if the wearer worships Erastil); **Effect** Choose a single creature within 30 feet. The stag's helm focuses your aim and grants supernatural insight into your next shot. Your target is flat-footed to the next ranged (action: \n Strike) you make this turn against them.",

    "description": "~ Perception: +12; darkvision 30 feet, hearing 30 feet (imprecise)\n~ Communication: telepathy (Celestial, Common, Dwarven, Undercommon)\n~ Skills: Alcohol Lore +13, Deception +15, Diplomacy +13, Religion +13, Society +15\n~ Int: +2, **Wis** +2, **Cha** +4\n~ Will: +15\n----\nIn life, the dwarven rogue Azarim was always something of an outsider among her people for her fast and loose relationship with dwarven tradition. However, she still harbored in her heart a fierce pride in what dwarves had accomplished. She had long fought against the cult of Droskar, seeing it as emblematic of all the worst parts of dwarven culture.\nBy the time she infiltrated Droskar's Crucible in 4065 AR, the cult was already in decline. She knew portions of Droskar's Crucible were built by the worshippers of Torag who preceded the cult and that something of great power had been locked away in the Lower Vault, but not what that object was. If she could gain control over the cult, she could simultaneously use them to open the Lower Vault and convince them to set aside their worship of Droskar—if not for her own patron, Cayden Cailean, then any other faith with a more positive leaning.\nUnfortunately, her attempt to seize control of the cult using their own traditions against them backfired when she succumbed to the Soul Smith. Unlike the others who were slain by the Soul Smith, Azarim's soul managed to somewhat escape being bound into the Soul Smith's soul chain by instead seeking shelter in her own magic rapier. Frustrated at the fact her soul slipped away but ignorant of where that soul fled to, the Soul Smith returned to his tasks and soon forgot about Azarim—she was, to the undead dwarf, just another in a long line of failures.\nToday, Azarim is an intelligent (item: +1|+1 Weapon Potency Runestone) (item: striking|Striking Runestone) (item: shifting|Shifting Runestone) (item: rapier). The rapier has been waiting patiently for centuries for a new, like-minded ally to take her up in arms against her foes. While she prefers to exist in the form of a rapier, she can use one of her actions to activate her shifting rune to take the shape of another weapon as needed.\nWhile Azarim prefers to be wielded by chaotic good characters, particularly those who worship Cayden Cailean, she's open-minded and eager to work with any wielder who seeks to oppose corrupting or toxic traditions in society, particularly those who work against the influence of the cult of Droskar. To wielders she doesn't approve of, she works to convince them to either change their ways or to hand her over to someone who she can work with, resorting to her ability to induce weakness in her carrier as needed when simply having them discard her is the only option left.\nAzarim deals an additional 1d6 chaotic damage to worshippers of Droskar, to creatures allied with Droskar's faith, and to those who are under the influence of Droskar's faith—which includes the Kobold King Merlokrep for as long as he continues to wear his crown as well as most of the intelligent inhabitants of the deeper levels of Droskar's Crucible.\n~ Activate: REACTION ; **Trigger** A creature picks up Azarim or begins its turn carrying Azarim; **Effect** The creature who carries Azarim becomes enfeebled 2. This condition persists as long as the creature carries Azarim. A non-lawful creature can attempt to resist this effect with a DC 23 Fortitude save, but lawful creatures don't gain a save to resist.\n----\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS command, (action: Interact); **Effect** Azarim casts 2nd-level (spell: illusory disguise) on her wielder. This effect ends immediately as soon as the wielder no longer carries Azarim.\n----\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS command, (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** Azarim bolsters her user's ability to lie. She can either attempt her own Deception check to resolve her wielder's (action: Lie), or she can assist with her wielder's attempt to (action: Lie) and grant a +2 circumstance bonus to the Deception check.\n----\n~ Activate: THREE-ACTIONS command, (action: Interact); **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Azarim gains the effects of an (item: anarchic|Anarchic Runestone) weapon rune for 1 minute. When wielded by a character who's at least 11th level, Azarim becomes a (itme: +2|+2 Weapon Potency Runestone) (item: striking|Striking Runestone)  (item: anarchic|Anarchic Runestone) (item: shifting|Shifting Runestone) (item: rapier), and instead this activation can be applied to another weapon that's in physical contact with Azarim.",

Once the cage lid is folded back over the head and latched in place, and as long as the decapitated head has been dead for no longer than 10 minutes before being placed inside the cresset, the head is no longer subject to decay, and bugs and pests (such as maggots) are prevented from consuming the remains. This doesn't prevent the rest of the corpse or its soul from becoming undead, nor does it prevent effects that restore life to the dead (but note that some spells, such as (spell: raise dead), can't be used to restore life to a decapitated corpse in the first place).

The cresset empowers the severed head with the ability to reply even without breath, granting the head a semblance of life, calling upon the physical remains' latent memories rather than summoning back the deceased's spirit. The head must be forcefully commanded to answer with a secret Intimidation check— other attempts to query the head without attempting an Intimidation check for a result automatically fail. Once activated in this way, this activation of a cresset of grisly interrogation can't be performed again for 1 hour. The head answers the question based on the result of the secret Intimidation check against the Will DC the creature had when it was alive or DC 25, whichever is higher.\nCritical Success: The head answers the question truthfully, to the best of its ability.\nSuccess: The head answers the question truthfully, but the answer is brief, cryptic, or repetitive.\nFailure: The head's answer provides false information, attempting to (action: Lie) to you with a +15 Deception modifier, or the creature's original Deception, whichever is higher.\nCritical Failure: As failure, but the head gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its Deception check, and the next time you use this activation of the cresset of grisly interrogation during the next 24 hours, the result of your Intimidation check is one degree of success worse than the result you rolled.",

    "description": "Originally, this magical crown was to be known as the Crown of Toil—a magic item crafted by the dwarven priest named Gristogar. He intended for the crown to bolster his ability to rule and herald in a new era of a dwarven kingdom that followed the teachings of Droskar. Yet Gristogar wasn't equal to his own ambitions, and before he could complete the Crown of Toil, his cult died out and he ended his own life. For centuries, the incomplete crown lay dormant, but over that time, fragments of Gristogar's soul infused it—not enough to transform it into a truly intelligent item, but enough to give it a rudimentary need and desire to be completed.\nWhen the Kobold King Merlokrep discovered the discarded crown and placed it upon his head, the crown at last had agency— if not in a hale and hearty dwarf, at least in the frame of a powerful and ambitious kobold. Just as the crown began influencing Merlokrep, so too did the Kobold King's personality influence the crown. Today, the device is known as the Crown of the Kobold King, and while it still urges the one who wears it to build a kingdom of endlessly toiling workers, it no longer does so in honor of Droskar. Instead, it seeks the rise of a brutal kobold kingdom.\nThe crown appears as a golden band surrounded by iron spikes that glisten with fresh blood—the addition of a kobold skull to the top is largely decorative, but one the crown has grown to “enjoy.” Even in its incomplete state, a few rituals away from its true potential, the Crown of the Kobold King is a potent item. Wearing the crown grants you a +2 item bonus to Intimidation checks and a +1 item bonus to saving throws against (trait: fear) effects.\n~ Activate: TWO-ACTIONS command, envision; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The crown infuses you with the glorious conviction that you're meant to rule, granting you a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and Charisma-based skill checks for 1 minute.\n----\n~ Activate: 10 minutes (envision, (action: Interact)); **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You cast a (spell: nightmare) spell.",

    "rarity": "UNIQUE",
    "description": "Briar was formed ages ago by the Eldest when they tore from Nyrissa's mind and spirit her capability to love, then solidified this emotional energy into a sword. They entrusted Briar's safe keeping to the Lantern King, who mischievously kept moving the sword from world to world, always near to the regions Nyrissa was focused on but always hidden from her so that he could privately enjoy the delicious irony that the thing she sought so ardently was always kept just out of reach.\nWhen first recovered by the PCs, Briar is a (item: +3|+3 Weapon Potency Runestone) (item: greater striking|Greater Striking Runestone) cold iron (item: bastard sword), but its additional powers remain dormant. These powers can be awakened as the PCs progress through Chapter 10. The process of awakening Briar requires that the weapon be present when First World blooms are defeated or when powerful creatures from the First World are slain—Briar need not be the weapon that defeats a bloom or slays a monster, but it must be in the immediate area (within 500 feet). Defeating a bloom or slaying a 17th-level or greater monster from the First World— including all creatures closely associated with a bloom—gives Briar a Sharpness Point. As it accumulates these points, it gains additional powers, as detailed below.\nOnce Briar gains the capability to speak, it can relate to its partner the sad tale of its creation, including the fact that it was created by the Lantern King using Nyrissa's capacity to love. Briar knows that without love, Nyrissa is as good as dead, and it suspects that only by being used to slay Nyrissa can it be returned to her soul. It doesn't know about the Lantern King's additional machinations, the nature of the Apology, or Nyrissa's reasons for attacking the Stolen Lands, and as such doesn't realize there is another method to be reunited with the nymph queen—see the end of Chapter 10.\nThe first time Briar is brought within 30 feet of Nyrissa, it automatically gains enough Sharpness Points to reach 20 points.\n~ 1 Sharpness Point: Briar becomes a (item: +3|+3 Weapon Potency Runestone) (item: greater striking|Greater Striking Runestone) (item: shifting|Shifting Runestone) cold iron (item: bastard sword).\n----\n~ 4 Sharpness Points: Briar becomes a (item: +3|+3 Weapon Potency Runestone) (item: major striking|Major Striking Runestone) (item: shifting|Shifting Runestone) cold iron (item: bastard sword). It gains the (trait: Intelligent) trait, becomes chaotic neutral, and gains the following statistics.\n~ Perception: +30, normal vision and hearing within 30 feet\n~ Communication: empathy (partner only)\n~ Skills: First World Lore +30, Nature +28\n~ Int: +0, **Wis** +0, **Cha** +3\n~ Will: +30\n~ Activate: ONE-ACTION command; **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** Briar casts (spell: barkskin) on its partner.\n----\n~ 8 Sharpness Points: Briar becomes a (item: +4|+4 Weapon Potency Runestone) (item: major striking|Major Striking Runestone) (item: shifting|Shifting Runestone) cold iron (item: bastard sword). Its statistics improve as follows. **Perception** +32, normal vision, darkvision, and hearing within 60 feet **Communication** speech (Aklo, Common, and Sylvan) **Skills** First World Lore +32, Nature +30 **Int** +2, **Wis** +2, **Cha** +5 **Will** +32\n~ Activate: ONE-ACTION command; **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** Briar casts a 4th-level (spell: barkskin) on its partner.\n----\n~ Activate: REACTION ; **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** Briar damages a plant creature; **Effect** Briar draws moisture out of the plant creature's body, dealing 10d10 negative damage (DC 39 basic Fortitude save)\n----\n----\n~ 14 Sharpness Points: Briar becomes a (item: +4|+4 Weapon Potency Runestone) (item: major striking|Major Striking Runestone) (item: shifting|Shifting Runestone) cold iron (item: bastard sword).

Its statistics improve as follows.\n~ Perception: +36, normal vision, darkvision, and hearing within 60 feet\n~ Communication: speech and telepathy (Aklo, Common, and Sylvan)\n~ Skills: First World Lore +36, Nature +34\n~ Int: +6, **Wis** +6, **Cha** +9\n~ Will: +36\n~ Activate: ONE-ACTION command; **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** Briar casts an 8th-level (spell: barkskin) on its partner.\n----\n~ Activate: REACTION ; **Frequency** once per month; **Trigger** Briar's partner would die; **Effect** Briar resurrects its partner. The partner returns to life with full Hit Points and the same spells prepared and points in their pools they had when they died, but still suffering from any long-term debilitations of the old body. The target is also permanently changed in some way that shifts their appearance slightly toward that of Nyrissa's, such as a green streak in the hair, a few thorny growths on the body, or a slight greenish cast to their skin.\n----\n~ Activate: REACTION ; **Trigger** Briar's partner (action: Strikes|Strike) Nyrissa with Briar for the first time in a round; **Effect** Nyrissa must make a successful DC 50 Fortitude save to resist being stunned 1 (stunned 3 on a critical failure). Briar's partner gains a +4 item bonus to all saving throws against Nyrissa's spells for 1 minute.\n----\n~ Destruction: The Lantern King can will Briar's destruction if he chooses. Alternately, defeating the Lantern King's aspect causes the sword's destruction. Once Briar is destroyed, Nyrissa regains the capability to love once again, but what she does next will depend on how the PCs treated her—assuming she survives.\nIf Nyrissa is slain, Briar immediately loses 1d6 Sharpness points. It can never again gain Sharpness points, and it continues to lose more at the rate of 1d6 every 24 hours. Once Briar's Sharpness points drop to 0 in this way, the sword is destroyed.",

When worn with light armor from the cloth, leather, or chain groups, a plated duster increases the armor's item bonus to AC by 1, worsens the armor's check penalty by 1, reduces the armor's Dex cap by 1, increases the Strength score required to ignore the armor check penalty and Speed penalty by 2, adds the (trait: noisy) trait, and changes the armor's group to composite.

    "description": "The pane of this large circular mirror has a diameter of 8 feet and a gray cast. The mirror reflects its surroundings in muted colors, and any living creatures that look into the mirror see themselves as preserved corpses with sallow skin, sunken cheeks, and a vacant expression. The mirror is mounted in a bone frame intricately carved with imagery of corvids, keys, and winding roads. These roads represent the Dead Roads, the secret back routes between the Boneyard and all other planes that are under the purview of the psychopomp usher Barzahk the Passage and their followers.\nPassage panes are created by incredibly powerful priests of Barzahk using mirrors that have reflected Barzahk during their travels from when Barzahk passes through mortal realms. Through prayer, powerful magic, and exceptional crafting skill, these mirrors form a spiritual connection to the Dead Roads, which can be harnessed to open a gate to the Boneyard.\nTo utilize a passage pane, the mirror must be securely mounted on a solid surface. Once mounted, a user must bond with the passage pane by gazing beyond their dead visage into the Dead Roads. Bonding takes patience and can only be accomplished by a living creature who has at least master proficiency in Religion and who succeeds at a DC 40 Religion check. Attempting to bond with the mirror in this way takes 1 hour. Once a creature is bonded with the mirror, they can use the passage pane to open a portal to a random point along the Dead Roads. A creature with knowledge of a location in the Boneyard can force the mirror to lock onto that location, allowing more pointed travel. Only one creature can be bonded with the mirror at a time. When a creature forms a bond with the mirror, any previous bonds are immediately severed. Undead can't bond with the passage pane.\nWhen Barzahk themself walks the Dead Roads, a depiction of them appears in the frame's carvings. When Barzahk is depicted in this way, they can prevent the passage pane from Activating or alter the destination of the passage pane, if desired.\n~ Activate: 1 minute (envision, (action: Interact); (trait: divination), (trait: divine), (trait: scrying)); **Requirements** The passage pane is mounted firmly to a solid surface, and you're bonded with the passage pane; **Effect** You focus on a location in the Boneyard that you wish to travel to. You must have either seen or visited this location before or be able to describe the location in detail and its purpose or name, as appropriate. Attempt a DC 40 Religion check. On a success, the mirror locks onto your desired location, and you (and only you) see this location reflected in the mirror's pane.\n----\n~ Activate: envision, (action: Interact) ((trait: conjuration), (trait: divine), (trait: teleportation)); **Requirements** The passage pane is an active rift to the Boneyard, and you're bonded with the passage pane; **Effect** You close the rift.\n----\n~ Destruction: The passage pane shatters into thousands of pieces if Barzahk the Passage bonds with the mirror and wills its destruction.",
