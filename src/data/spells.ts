Choose one of the following words, which indicates the type of people involved and type of event you learn about.\n* Wardens: city guards, barristers, and judges (criminal reports, busts, changes in routines, legal trials)\n* Titles: nobles and politicians (high society weddings, elite soirees, political rallies)\n* Masses: common folk and merchants (gathering mobs, major sales)\nWhen uttering your word, you can exclude events you already know about, whether you know about them from this spell or from other experiences. If you cast Pulse of the City again within 24 hours, you can say “echo” instead of another word to get an update on the event you learned about the last time you (activity: Cast the Spell | Cast a Spell).\nPulse of the City reveals only publicly available or observable information. You never learn clandestine movements or other details people are specifically trying to hide. The spell is also notoriously bad at overcoming magic meant to avoid detection; it automatically fails to reveal information about events involving creatures, places, or objects affected by spells that could prevent or counteract pulse of the city (such as (spell: nondetection)).",

Unlike with the (Spell: illusory creature) spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn’t include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a (Spell: hallucinatory terrain) spell.\nWhen you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it’s hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You’re unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.\nAny creature that touches any part of the image or uses the (Action: Seek) action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

Each pillar is 5 feet by 5 feet in length and width. The pillars must be conjured on a relatively flat area of natural earthen terrain such as sand, dirt, stone, or clay. Regardless of the terrain, the pillars are always made of tightly compacted sand particles that together become as hard and solid as stone (DC 15 Athletics to (Action: Climb)).\nIf a creature occupies the space where you cast this spell, it is carried upward atop the pillar. The creature can attempt a Reflex save (DC equal to the caster’s spell DC); on a success, the creature can either attempt to (Action: Grab an Edge) or move into an adjacent unoccupied square. If the pillar would rise higher than the ceiling, it firmly abuts the ceiling but does not rise any higher. A creature caught between a pillar and a ceiling takes no damage (subject to GM discretion, such as is in the case of stalactites or other hazards) but becomes immobilized. The creature can attempt an (Action: Escape) check to free itself, but it must thereafter (Action: Grab an Edge), (Action: Climb) down, or fall from the top of the pillar. The (Action: Grab an Edge) and (Action: Escape) DCs are the same as the Reflex save.\nAs part of your action to Sustain the Spell, you can choose to either destroy one of your pillars, causing it to immediately crumble into nothing, or create a new pillar, as long as doing so wouldn’t exceed the total number of feet of pillar you can create.

The guardian uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty.\nAlternatively, when you (action: Sustain the Spell | Sustain a Spell), you can have the guardian move adjacent to an ally and protect that ally. If you do, each time the ally would take damage, the guardian takes the first 10 damage instead of your ally. It continues to do so until you move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different ally, or until the guardian is destroyed (it has 50 Hit Points and can’t recover Hit Points by any means). The guardian can’t usually take damage except when protecting an ally, though (spell: disintegrate) automatically destroys it if it hits the spiritual guardian’s AC of 25.\nThe guardian’s (action: Strikes | Strike) are melee spell attacks. Regardless of the appearance of the guardian’s weapon, the guardian deals force damage equal to 2d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, but you can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon it holds instead of force damage.

Plane shift doesn’t provide a means of return travel, though casting plane shift again allows you to return to your previous plane unless there are extenuating circumstances.",

If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends.\nThe image can’t speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you’re trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.\nIn combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you (action: Sustain the Spell | Sustain a Spell). It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC – 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.\nThe illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion’s attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a (Action: Strike), the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a (trait: mental) effect. The illusion’s (Action: Strikes | Strike) are (trait: nonlethal). If the damage doesn’t correspond to the image of the monster – for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage – the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.\nAny creature that touches the image or uses the (Action: Seek) action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

You can gain this effect multiple times in the same round by (action: Sustaining the Spell | Sustain a Spell) multiple times. The orb can move through the spaces of any creatures or obstacles that wouldn’t stop the flow of water. It extinguishes non-magical fires it moves through of its size or smaller, and it attempts to counteract any magical fires it moves through. If it fails to counteract a given fire, it can’t counteract that fire for the duration of the spell.\nThe orb can also collect creatures it moves through. Any Large or smaller creature whose space the orb tries to move through can attempt a Reflex save against your spell DC to avoid being engulfed. If a creature succeeds at this save, it can either let the orb pass (remaining in its space or moving out of the orb’s path into a space of the creature’s choice) or allow itself to be pushed in front of the orb to the end of the orb’s movement. The orb can try to engulf the same creature only once per turn, even if you roll it onto a creature’s space more than once.\nA creature that fails its save is pulled into the orb. It becomes grabbed, moves along with the orb, and must hold its breath or begin suffocating (unless it can breathe in water). An engulfed Medium or smaller creature and anyone trying to affect that creature follow the normal rules for aquatic battles (page 478). An engulfed Large creature is usually big enough that parts of it stick out from the water, and it can reach out of the water. An engulfed creature can get free either by (action: Swimming | Swim) with a successful DC 10 Athletics check or by (action: Escaping | Escape) against your spell DC. A creature that critically failed its Reflex save is further stuck and must attempt to (action: Escape) instead of (action: Swim). A freed creature exits the orb’s space and can immediately breathe. The orb can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space.\nWhen the spell ends, all creatures the orb has engulfed are automatically released.",

Skymetals such as adamantine and orichalcum are immune to this rust, and the GM might determine other precious materials are similarly resilient. Ultimately, the GM decides if an object or creature can be targeted with this spell. All damage from this spell ignores Hardness. If the spell causes persistent damage from rust, a creature can attempt to scrape off the rust to assist the target in recovering from the persistent damage (reducing the DC of the flat check to end persistent damage to 10 and granting an immediate flat check). The effect of the spell depends on its target.\n* Creature or Hazard: A creature or hazard must be made of all or mostly metal to be affected (this includes many mechanical traps). It takes 8d6 damage (basic Fortitude save), plus 2d6 persistent damage on a failed save. Touching a hazard to affect it with this spell might trigger the hazard, as determined by the GM.\n* Item: The rust deals 2d6 damage, subject to a basic Reflex save by the creature wearing or holding the item; if the item is unattended, it automatically gets a critical failure. On a failed save, the item also takes 1d6 persistent damage. For an attended item, this persistent damage occurs at the end of the attending creature's turns; if the item was unattended when you (action: Cast the Spell | Cast a Spell), the damage happens at the end of your turns.\nWhen targeting armor someone is wearing, its Bulk is 1 higher than the listed value, since carrying armor is more cumbersome than wearing it.

    "description": "You place an invisible scrying sensor on each target just above their eyes. Each sensor looks where that target looks, and all the targets can link their vision briefly to help notice things one target sees but the others might not. Each target can use an action, which has the (trait: concentrate) trait, to share what it sees with any number of other targets until the start of its next turn. Only one creature can share its vision at a time, so if another target takes this action, the effect ends for any target that was previously sharing its vision.\nThis improves how well the recipients can perceive anything the sharing creature is looking at. For instance, if a creature is undetected to a recipient but observed by the sharing creature, the creature becomes observed by the recipient as well. Typically, the creature is seen as a glowing outline superimposed on its position. This might allow the recipient to target a creature it couldn’t otherwise; however, cover and line of effect still might prevent or impede targeting and attacks. This can only improve the recipient’s vision, not reduce it; for example, if an enemy was undetected by the sharing creature and observed by a recipient, the recipient would still clearly observe the enemy.\nOnce the vision sharing stops, the benefit ends. Whether a creature is hidden or undetected is still based on the last information a target had before the vision sharing ended. For example, that means if a creature is behind a wall but hasn’t moved, it’s still hidden rather than undetected by a recipient that witnessed its current position.",

You can also make one attempt to (action: Steal) as part of (action: Casting | Cast a Spell) umbral extraction.

If the target has no spell slots of that level, use the highest level below that in which the target does have a spell slot. (If the target has no eligible spells, you get nothing, but you can continue to attempt to (action: Steal) spells for the remaining duration.) If the target is a prepared caster, you randomly steal one of their prepared spells.

You know what the spell is as soon as you steal it, and your temporary spell slot becomes a spell slot of the same level as the spell you stole.\nAs normal, you can (action: Steal) only from a target within your reach. Once you’ve placed a spell in your temporary spell slot, you can’t attempt to (action: Steal) more spells. If you succeed at your Thievery check, you must take the spell you stole. Even if you’re a spontaneous caster, you can use the temporary spell slot only to cast the stolen spell and you can cast only the stolen spell from your temporary spell slot.

During umbral graft’s duration, you can use the (action: Steal) action to attempt to abscond with spells affecting a foe instead of stealing an item. You can also make one attempt to (action: Steal) as part of (action: Casting | Cast a Spell) umbral graft. If you succeed at your check to (action: Steal) a spell, randomly determine a spell affecting the foe that has a target entry. That spell ceases to affect the target, and you can either cause the spell to affect you or store it in your shadow. If your attempt to (action: Steal) was a critical success, you automatically steal the spell if its level is equal to or lower than umbral graft. If it was a success, you automatically steal it if its level is lower than umbral graft. If you succeeded, but the spell’s level was too high to steal automatically, you must attempt a counteract check to see if you steal the spell. You know what the spell is as soon as you steal it. If you store it, you can transfer it to a willing creature as a single action that has the (trait: manipulate) trait. The spell lasts for its remaining duration, to a maximum of 1 minute, and any time you keep it stored subtracts from its duration normally. The spell gains the (trait: shadow) trait.\nYou can’t steal constant innate spells that are always active on a creature, such as a choral angel’s constant (spell: tongues), or innate spells that have special restrictions that remove their ability to target other creatures, such as an imp’s (spell: invisibility). At the GM’s discretion, you might not be able to steal innate spells with other unusual modifications to the base spell.\nAs normal, you can (action: Steal) only from a target within your reach. Once you’ve stolen a spell, you can’t attempt to (action: Steal) more spells, nor can you choose not to take a spell if you succeed at your Thievery check. When you cast umbral graft, any spells you stole with a previous umbral graft end even if their duration hasn’t elapsed. If you’re affected by both umbral graft and umbral extraction, you make the choice whether to steal a spell slot, an active spell, or an item each time you (action: Steal).",

If you do, the fort remains for another 24 hours.\nThe fort must be created on a plot of land free of other structures. It adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural requirements for being built there. The fort adjusts around small features, such as ponds or spires of rock, but can't be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the foundation reaches solid ground. If created on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, roll a DC 3 flat check each day the fort is present; on a failure, the fort sinks or collapses sometime during that day, and the spell ends.\nThe fort doesn't harm creatures within the area when it appears, and it can't be created within a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the fort when the spell is cast ends up unharmed inside the complete fort and always has a clear path of escape.",

The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you and repeats a basic single action the target took since the end of your last turn, such as making a (action: Strike) or (action: Interacting|Interact) to pull a lever. Because the other basic single actions don't produce much of a result on their own, this is typically used for (action: Strike) and (action: Interact), though occasionally it could be useful to have a temporal twin (action: Stride) through a potentially dangerous area to expose a hazard. The target ally spends a reaction to create the duplicate, makes any decisions, and rolls for the repeated action, such as choosing a target for a (action: Strike) and making the attack roll. If the ally doesn't have a reaction to spend, temporal twin fails. Use the duplicate's location for determining flanking, cover, and the like. Using this spell requires remembering what your ally did, and if you don't remember the details, the GM might not allow you to cast temporal twin.\nThis action can't be used for anything but a basic single action, nor can it use limited resources. The action can have a different target than the original action but must be very similar in form. For example, if the original action were to Interact to pull a lever, the time duplicate could pull a different lever, but couldn't turn a doorknob or pick up an item from a table.\nBeing pulled through time to create a twin destabilizes the target's timeline. Once an ally has been the target of temporal twin, they're temporarily immune for 1 day.",

Its form is that of an immense titan of flesh and metal with long, muscular, twisted arms. The Bone Breaker releases a hum at a harmonic frequency that weakens bones in creatures' bodies. Each foe within an 80-foot emanation must attempt a Fortitude save. On a critical success, they're unaffected; on a success, they're enfeebled 2 for 1 round; on a failure they're enfeebled 3 for 1 minute; and on a critical failure, they're enfeebled 4 for 10 minutes. A skeleton or other undead foe made almost entirely of bones treats their result as one degree of success worse than they rolled. **Depart** __Bruising Departure__ The Bone Breaker pounds its long arms into the ground, creating a long shockwave. Each foe within a 100-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line takes 8d12 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Fortitude save.\n* Scion of Desiccation: __Size__ Gargantuan, __Speed__ 100 feet, fly 100 feet; **Arrive** ((trait: necromancy), (trait: negative)) __Ashes to Ashes__ The Scion of Desiccation appears in a swirl of screaming wind, a gargantuan form of twisted flesh that's constantly flensed by gritty ash and dust, and just as constantly regenerating itself. Each foe within a 40-foot emanation takes 10d10 negative energy damage, with a basic Fortitude save; **Depart** ((trait: necromancy), (trait: negative)) __Dust to Dust__ Each foe within a 60-foot emanation must attempt a Fortitude save; they're drained 2 on a failure or drained 4 on a critical failure.\n* The Thousand: __Size__ Medium (see below), __Speed__ 30 feet; **Arrive** ((trait: emotion), (trait: enchantment), (trait: fear), (trait: mental)) __Disconcerting Arrival__ Select five spaces in range and summon a Medium-sized polyp of The Thousand in each of these spaces. The Thousand is an entity whose full scope is 1,000 polyps of oozing flesh, each physically separate but mentally part of a single creature. Not all 1,000 polyps have survived, and the spell summons five of them. Each creature within 10 feet of any of the polyps must attempt a Will Save.

The Thorn Caller's body is an ornate armored sphere with black panther masks surrounding a glowing light. The ball floats in the air due to six glowing, thornlike wings. Two clusters of bird heads emerge from both sides of the body with long necks that twirl together like tentacles. The Thorn Caller's burst of light illuminates all foes within 200 feet. The foes become dazzled and flat-footed, and if they were invisible, they become concealed instead. These effects last until the Thorn Caller departs. **Depart** __Thorn-Burst__ The Thorn Caller launches its thorned wings at various targets. Attempt spell attack rolls against up to 6 different targets within 300 feet. On a hit, the target takes 10d8 piercing damage, double on a critical hit, half on a failure, and none on a critical failure.",

On a hit, the target takes 2d6 slashing damage. On a critical hit, double the damage, and the target also takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage. If this spell's damage kills the target, the corpse is only bones.\n~ Undead Creature: Make a spell attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 slashing damage. On a critical hit, double the damage, and the target also becomes enfeebled 1 for 1 minute. If this spell's damage destroys the target, only its bare bones remain behind.",
