While possessing a target, a possessor’s true body is unconscious (and can’t wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage. A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target’s active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target’s abilities that are purely physical, and it can’t use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target’s attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack roll, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor’s invested items apply when using its own values, and the target’s invested items apply when using the target’s values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn’t in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the possession ends immediately and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.",

Each tattoo has the (trait: invested) trait to indicate this limitation—a magical tattoo is like an invested item that the tattooed creature has no choice but to invest. If the tattoo loses its magic or is destroyed, it no longer reduces your investiture.\nJust like a physical magic item, a magical tattoo can be counteracted by spells like (spell: dispel magic) or (spell: disjunction). If destroyed, the tattoo fades from the skin.\nIf a creature gets a new magical tattoo when their limit on invested items has already been reduced to zero, the new tattoo’s magic fails to take hold, and it becomes a non-magical tattoo instead. However, a tattooist can alter an existing tattoo when they (action: Craft) a tattoo, modifying the old one into a different magical tattoo and removing the old effect. Magical tattoos can usually be upgraded into their greater versions (CRB pg. 535) by having a tattooist add to or modify the existing tattoo.",

    "description": "A spell with the incarnate trait is similar in theme to spells that summon creatures, but it doesn’t conjure a minion with the (trait: summoned) trait. Instead, when summoned, the incarnate creature takes its Arrive action when you finish (action: Casting the Spell | Cast a Spell). At the end of your next turn, the incarnate creature can either (action: Step), (action: Stride), or take the action for another movement type it has (such as (action: Climb) or (action: Burrow)), and then takes its Depart action. The spell then ends. The names of specific Arrive and Depart actions are listed in italics after the word “Arrive” or “Depart” respectively, along with any traits.\nA creature summoned by an incarnate spell acts in your interests, directs its effects away from you and your allies as much as possible, and might listen to your requests, but ultimately makes its own decisions. If the spell indicates that the incarnate makes a decision, the GM determines what the incarnate would do. It might even become more inclined to do precisely as you wish over multiple summonings.\nThe incarnate is not fully a creature. It can’t take any other actions, nor can it be targeted or harmed by (action: Strikes | Strike), spells, or other effects unless they would be able to target or end a spell effect (such as (spell: dispel magic)). It has a size for the purposes of determining its placement for effects, but it doesn’t block movement. If applicable, its effects use your spell DCs and spell attack roll modifier.",

On a critical failure, you also take an amount of fire damage equal to your level. As the innovation’s creator, you can spend 10 minutes retuning your innovation and making adjustments to return it to functionality, at which point you can use unstable actions with that innovation again.\nTo take an unstable action, you must be using your innovation (for example, wearing an armor innovation or wielding a weapon innovation). If you have a minion innovation, some unstable actions are taken by the minion instead of you. In these cases, only the minion can take that action, and the minion needs to have been Commanded that turn to take the action. If you critically fail the flat check, the minion takes the damage instead of you.\nSome actions have an Unstable Function entry, which you can use to add the unstable trait for a bigger benefit.

A combination weapon has both a firearm form or usage and a melee weapon form or usage.\nThe melee weapon form uses the damage die and damage type listed in the parentheses instead. Any bulk, hands, or trait differences while in melee weapon form can be found in the weapon description.\nSwitching between the melee weapon usage and the firearm usage requires an (action: Interact) action. However, if your last action was a successful melee (action: Strike) against a foe using a combination weapon, you can make a firearm (action: Strike) with the combination weapon against that foe without fully switching to the firearm usage, firing the firearm just as you hit with the melee attack. In this case, the combination weapon returns to its melee usage after the firearm (action: Strike).\nSince a combination weapon is one weapon with two usages, both usages share any fundamental runes. You can put a property rune on a combination weapon as long as it’s appropriate for either of the two usages, but if only one of the usages meets the property rune’s requirements, the effects of the property rune only apply for that usage. For instance, a vorpal axe musket only applies the vorpal property rune when you are using it as an axe. Due to their complexity, combination weapons can’t have another weapon, such as a bayonet or reinforced stock, attached to them.",

An item with multiple shadow gifts might begin to lose its color. With four or five, the character that wields it might take on an ashen tone and the relic might become entirely made of shadow.\nMany gifts allow for a saving throw or have other abilities that change as the relic goes up in level. The DC for any saving throw called for by a gift is its owner’s class DC or spell DC. The spell attack modifier of a gift is 10 lower than that DC.
